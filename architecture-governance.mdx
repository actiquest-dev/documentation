# Enterprise Governance Layer

The Governance Layer provides the necessary guardrails for deploying Membria's Reasoning Graph in a multi-tenant, high-stakes enterprise environment. It integrates **VoI-based prioritization** and **POMDP belief tracking** to ensure decision integrity.

### Half-Life Model (Revised)

Causal relationships in business are not static. Market conditions change, rendering past "truths" invalid. Membria implements a domain-specific decay model to track "Knowledge Volatility":

- **Market dynamics:** 90 days half-life.
- **Vendor relationships:** 180 days half-life.
- **Regulatory/legal:** STEPPED (valid until explicit change event).
- **Technical architecture:** 365 days half-life.

**Mathematical Logic:**
- **Decay Function:** $Belief_{t} = Belief_{t_0} \cdot e^{-\lambda(t-t_0)}$
- **Evidence Refresh:** When a new `Outcome` is recorded, the decay timer resets. The weight is updated via Beta-distribution infusion ($Outcome("success"): Beta(\alpha, \beta) \to Beta(\alpha+1, \beta)$).
- **Conflict Acceleration:** If a new outcome contradicts an existing edge → accelerate decay (half-life $\div$ 2).

## 2. Multi-Tenant Graph RBAC

To ensure data privacy and prevent cross-departmental information leaks, Membria implements fine-grained access control at the graph level.

### Policy-Based Retrieval
- **Node Sensitivity:** Every node has a `sensitivity_level` (Public, Internal, Secret).
- **Access Scope:** The `Retrieval Orchestrator` automatically injects security predicates into Cypher queries based on the user's `session_token`.
- **Atomic Locking:** Secret nodes are excluded from the Vector Index used by general-purpose agents.

## 3. Conflict Resolution & Human Override

When the Causal Layer contradicts a Human Decision or a Reasoning-based proposal, a formal resolution protocol must be followed.

### The Override Log
If a human decision-maker chooses to proceed against a "Negative Knowledge" alert:
1. **Explicit Justification:** The user must provide a rationale (recorded as a `SUPERSEDES` relationship).
2. **Context Shift Label:** The system tags the decision with `HYPOTHESIS_CONTEXT_SHIFT`, signaling that the user believes the old causal model is no longer valid.
3. **High-Stakes Flag:** These overrides are automatically escalated for monitoring.

## 4. Causal Discovery Agent (Debriefing Loop)

When a prediction fails, the system searches for the missing **Confounder**.

### The Recursive Search
The Causal Discovery Agent triggers a post-outcome debriefing session:
- **Search:** It queries external APIs for variables that moved during the Decision Window.
- **Candidate Generation:** It proposes new `Variable` nodes that could explain the deviation.
- **Node Injection:** If confirmed, the new Confounder is added to the graph.

## 5. Multi-Agent Consensus (Collision Prevention)

Transactional locking and simulation to prevent "Causal Collisions" between autonomous agents.
