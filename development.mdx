title: 'Client layer: DBB & Decision Surface'
description: 'How the client captures decisions and surfaces signals without backend escalation'
---

<Info>
  The client layer includes the Decision Black Box (DBB) and the Decision Surface (DS). DBB captures decision pivots locally; DS renders signals from immutable decision records.
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Capture decision moments">
DBB watches interaction streams (chat, docs, notes). It detects commitment phrases, extracts context and alternatives, and freezes reasoning before outcomes contaminate memory.
</Step>
<Step title="Create immutable decision records">
Each decision record includes assumptions, alternatives, confidence, and predictions. Records are append-only; outcomes are attached later without rewriting the original.
</Step>
<Step title="Render signals in the Decision Surface">
DS presents open loops, drift, pending outcomes, and track record signals. It does not read raw chat, only DBB outputs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Minimal UI touches

- Inline capture cues near messages that became decision candidates.
- Decision Surface cards with signal summaries.
- A low-friction panel for confirm/edit/reject.

## Client vs backend

| Client layer (DBB/DS) | Backend layer (KCG/DoD/Gateways) |
| --- | --- |
| Captures decisions and reasoning locally | Escalates to external LLM council when needed |
| Immutable decision records | Immutable knowledge payloads (Arweave) |
| Decision Surface signals | Knowledge Cache Graph + gateway consensus |

When a decision requires external knowledge or verification, the client sends a DoD request to the backend. The backend writes a knowledge event and returns a verified answer that the client can store or reference.
