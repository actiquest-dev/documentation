<Note>
  The Decision API lets you read decision drafts, publish outcomes, and export the history that powers the Decision Surface.

## Overview

The DBB populates the Decision Ledger, and the Decision API exposes that ledger for integrations, dashboards, or export pipelines.

- **Decision records** include the context, confidence, alternatives, prediction, and evidence references.
- **Outcome append** ensures immutability—original entries remain, and outcome notes are added separately.
- **Signals** such as drift, open loops, and principle violations are computed on top of the ledger but can be derived from the API if desired.
