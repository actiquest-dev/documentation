# Membria: Target Audience & Honest Limitations

## Who Membria Is For (And Who It's Not)

---

## Executive Summary

Membria is a **team product**, not an individual tool. This document provides honest guidance on where Membria delivers value and where simpler alternatives work better.

**Core insight:** Membria solves the problem of **institutional knowledge loss in teams**. If you don't have a team, you don't have this problem.

---

## The Problem Membria Solves

```
Team of 8 developers, project running 18 months:

├── Alice made architecture decision in March
├── Alice left the company in July
├── Bob joins in September
├── Bob: "Why is it built this way?"
├── Everyone: "Historical reasons... Alice knew"
├── Bob tries different approach
├── Approach fails (Alice tried it, didn't work)
├── 2 weeks wasted
└── Repeat across dozens of decisions
```

**This is the problem.** Knowledge walks out the door. Decisions get forgotten. Mistakes repeat.

## Ideal Customer Profile

### ✅ Membria IS For

```
Team characteristics:
├── Size: 5-20 developers
├── Project lifespan: > 12 months
├── Turnover: people join/leave occasionally
├── Complexity: architectural decisions matter
├── Pain: "Why is it like this?" is a frequent question
└── Culture: willing to invest in tooling

Industry signals:
├── Regulated industries (audit trail required)
├── Enterprise software (long-lived codebases)
├── Agencies with long-term client relationships
├── Scale-ups growing engineering team
└── Companies with remote/distributed teams

Budget reality:
├── $49/seat/month is acceptable
├── 3-6 month ROI horizon is OK
├── Has engineering manager who owns tooling decisions
└── Values reducing onboarding time
```

### ❌ Membria is NOT For

```
Solo developers:
├── You ARE the institutional memory
├── You remember your own decisions
├── README.md per project is sufficient
├── $49/month for memory you already have = waste
└── Exception: agency owner with 50+ clients over 5+ years

Small teams (2-3 people):
├── Sync happens naturally (daily standups)
├── Everyone knows everything
├── Slack search is good enough
├── Low turnover impact
└── CLAUDE.md + good docs = sufficient

Short projects (< 6 months):
├── Not enough time to accumulate decisions
├── Outcomes won't materialize before project ends
├── No negative knowledge will form
├── ROI = zero
└── Setup cost > benefit

Early-stage startups:
├── Everything changes constantly
├── "Decisions" get reversed weekly
├── Need speed, not documentation
├── Team is 2-4 people who talk constantly
└── Premature optimization of knowledge management

Contractors/freelancers:
├── Project ends, relationship ends
├── Client owns the codebase anyway
├── Handoff document is sufficient
├── No long-term maintenance responsibility
└── Per-project README works fine
```

---

## Why Solo Developers Don't Need Membria

### Argument: "Solo dev with many projects"

```
Claim:
├── Solo dev juggles 5 projects
├── Switches context constantly
├── Membria remembers decisions across all projects
├── Value: cross-project memory

Reality check: ❌
```

### Counter-argument 1: Context doesn't transfer

```
Decision in Project A: "Use Redis for caching"
Context A: High load, distributed system, 10k req/s

Project D: Simple CRUD for small business
Membria: "You used Redis in A!"
Reality: Redis is overkill here, SQLite is fine

Cross-project decisions are CONTEXTUAL.
What worked in A may be wrong for D.
```

### Counter-argument 2: Solo dev IS the memory

```
Team scenario:
├── Alice decides X
├── Bob doesn't know
├── Carol redoes work
└── Need: shared memory system

Solo scenario:
├── I decided X
├── I know why
├── I remember context
└── Need: nothing, I AM the memory
```

### Counter-argument 3: README.md is free

```
Project A/README.md:
  ## Architecture Decisions
  - Redis for cache (high load requirement)
  - Fastify over Express (performance)
  
  ## What Didn't Work
  - Custom auth middleware (security issues)

Time to write: 10 minutes
Cost: $0
Accessibility: always, even offline
Maintenance: update when needed

vs Membria:
Cost: $49/month = $588/year
For what? Queryable version of README?
```

### Counter-argument 4: Outcome tracking is obvious for solo

```
Membria value prop: "Compare predicted vs actual outcomes"

Solo dev reality:
├── Delivered project → client happy → SUCCESS
├── Delivered project → client unhappy → FAILURE
├── This is immediately obvious
└── No formal tracking needed

Calibration makes sense when:
├── Multiple people with different accuracy
├── Need to identify WHO consistently fails
├── Need metrics for management review

Solo dev = self-managing, no bureaucracy needed
```

---

## Why Small Teams (2-3) Can Skip Membria

### Natural sync is sufficient

```
3-person team:
├── Daily standup: 15 minutes
├── Everyone hears every decision
├── Slack channel: all discussions visible
├── PR reviews: everyone sees everything
└── Implicit shared memory through proximity
```

### Low turnover impact

```
If 1 of 3 people leaves:
├── 2 people still remember everything
├── Onboarding 1 new person is manageable
├── Pair programming for 2 weeks = knowledge transfer
└── No system needed

Membria ROI requires:
├── Enough turnover that knowledge is lost
├── Team large enough that not everyone knows everything
├── Neither applies to 3-person team
```

---

## Honest Limitations (Even for Ideal Customers)

### 1. Cold start problem

```
Day 1 with Membria:
├── Empty graph
├── No past decisions
├── No negative knowledge
├── No calibration data
├── Value = zero

vs Day 1 with CLAUDE.md:
├── Write context in 30 minutes
├── Claude immediately understands project
├── Value = immediate

Membria requires 2-3 months to become useful
```

### 2. Discipline still required

```
Membria workflow:
1. Decision detected
2. Developer must CONFIRM (1 click) ← still requires action
3. If ignored → graph stays empty

What happens in practice:
├── "I'll confirm later" → never
├── "This isn't a decision" → dismiss everything
├── "Deadline, no time" → skip
└── Graph = empty or garbage

Less discipline than MD, but NOT zero discipline
```

### 3. Adoption requires buy-in

```
To make Membria work:
├── Buy-in from entire team
├── IDE integration setup
├── CI/CD integration
├── Issue tracker integration
├── Team training
├── Workflow changes
├── Champion who drives adoption
└── 3-6 months until ROI

vs CLAUDE.md:
├── Create file
├── Write context
└── Done in 30 minutes
```

### 4. Negative knowledge can become innovation blocker

```
Scenario:
├── 2023: Tried library X, didn't work
├── Negative knowledge: "X doesn't work"
├── 2025: X releases v2.0, completely rewritten
├── Developer wants to try new X
├── Membria: ⚠️ "X failed before!"
└── Team stuck on old decisions
```

### 5. Privacy and security concerns

```
Membria stores:
├── All team decisions
├── Who decided what
├── Mistakes and failures
├── Confidence levels
├── Reasoning behind decisions

Questions:
├── Where is data stored?
├── Who has access?
├── Can it be used against employees?
│   "Your decisions fail 40% of the time"
├── Compliance (GDPR, SOC2)?
└── What if Membria shuts down?
```

## Comparison: When to Use What

| Situation | Recommendation | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Solo developer | README.md per project | Free, simple, you ARE the memory |
| 2-3 person team | CLAUDE.md + good docs | Natural sync is enough |
| Short project (< 6 months) | ADR in repo | Won't reach Membria ROI |
| Early startup | Nothing formal | Everything changes too fast |
| Contractor/freelancer | Handoff document | Relationship ends with project |
| **5-20 person team** | **Membria** | **Shared memory problem is real** |
| **Project > 12 months** | **Membria** | **Enough time to reach ROI** |
| **Regulated industry** | **Membria** | **Audit trail requirement** |
| **High turnover environment** | **Membria** | **Knowledge preservation critical** |
| **Growing engineering org** | **Membria** | **...** |

---

## Honest Pitch

### Don't say:

> "Membria helps all developers write better code with AI"

### Do say:

> "Membria is for engineering teams of 5-20 people working on long-lived projects, where decisions get forgotten, mistakes repeat, and onboarding new people takes too long. If you've ever said 'we tried that before but I don't remember why it failed' — that's the problem we solve."

## Qualification Questions for Sales

Before engaging a prospect, ask:

1. **Team size?**
   - < 5: probably not a fit
   - 5-20: ideal
   - > 20: enterprise conversation

2. **Project lifespan?**
   - < 6 months: not a fit
   - 6-12 months: maybe
   - > 12 months: ideal

3. **Have you experienced knowledge loss from turnover?**
   - No: may not feel the pain
   - Yes: strong fit

4. **Do you have repeated mistakes / "we tried that" moments?**
   - No: may not need Membria
   - Yes: core use case

5. **Is someone willing to champion adoption?**
   - No: will fail
   - Yes: can succeed

## Summary

| Audience | Membria Fit | Alternative |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Solo dev | ❌ No | README.md |
| 2-3 person team | ❌ No | CLAUDE.md + docs |
| Short project | ❌ No | ADR in repo |
| Early startup | ❌ No | Move fast, document later |
| Freelancer | ❌ No | Handoff docs |
| **5-20 person team** | **✅ Yes** | **—** |
| **Project > 12 months** | **✅ Yes** | **—** |

**Membria is a team product for teams with team problems.**

If you don't have a team, or your team is small enough that everyone knows everything, simpler tools work fine. That's honest, and that's OK — focus on customers who genuinely need the product.
