# Deployment and hosting

## Cloud
Membria Cloud is the initial managed deployment path. The client runtime runs in a managed environment and connects to the decentralized knowledge backend.

## Self-hosted (planned)
Self-hosted CE will run the local SLM, memory, and GraphRAG on device, with optional escalation to the Council.

## Data placement
- Local memory stays on device in self-hosted mode
- Escalations send only the query and required context
