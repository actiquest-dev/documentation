## Membria CE (Community Edition / Personal)

Membria CE is a personal AI system that accumulates your reasoning, decisions, and knowledge over time.

Unlike traditional AI tools that reset context on every conversation, Membria introduces a Smart Persistence Layer for AI — a system that preserves how you think, decide, and reason across chats, tools, and models.

Membria CE runs local-first.
Your primary model, reasoning context, and decision capture live on your device.
When local intelligence is not enough, Membria escalates selectively and stores validated results in a decentralized knowledge backend — used for persistence, verification, and reuse, not for replacing local reasoning.

Over time, Membria becomes your second memory:
capturing decisions, tracking assumptions, linking outcomes, and building a long-term reasoning graph that grows more accurate and more personal the more you use it.

Membria CE is designed for power users, AI builders, and independent thinkers who want an AI that compounds intelligence instead of starting from scratch every day.
