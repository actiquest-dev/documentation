## 1. Mission and scope

Membria CE is building a decentralized, permanent knowledge base for small language models. The token model aligns knowledge creation, validation, and reuse with network incentives.

## 2. Participants

- **Users / knowledge creators**: initiate DoD requests and consume verified knowledge.
- **Gateways**: validate, process, cache, and commit knowledge to the network.
- **Validators**: secure the Peaq chain and participate in consensus.

## 3. Token overview

Two assets are used:

1. **$ACTI (core token)**: deflationary utility token used for staking, governance, and rewards. Tradable.
2. **$kCREDIT (knowledge credit)**: non-transferable credit used for bootstrap programs. Not tradable.

## 4. DoD pricing (dynamic)

- **Target price**: $0.10 per DoD request.
- **Conversion**: `Fee_in_ACTI = $0.10 / Current_ACTI_Price`.
- **Price stability**:
  - 24h TWAP from oracles.
  - Ceiling: $0.15.
  - Floor: $0.05.

## 5. Fee distribution (v2.0)

```
100% DoD payment
- 25% burn
- 60% gateway operator commission
- 10% consensus quorum rewards
- 5% ecosystem fund
```

Team-owned gateways do not receive commissions; their share is redistributed to independent operators.

## 6. Network accumulation effect

As KCG grows, cache hit rate increases (target 85%), so the average user cost trends downward even though DoD price remains fixed.

## 7. Deflation model

- **Primary burn**: 25% of every DoD payment.
- **Secondary burn**: slashing penalties for malicious gateways.

Illustrative burn at scale:

- 10,000 users: ~$675,000/year, ~16.9M tokens/year at $0.04 (3.4% supply).
- 50,000 users: ~$3.375M/year, ~84M tokens/year at $0.04 (16.8% supply).

Supply dynamics:

- **Phase 1 (0-24 months)**: vesting creates moderate inflation, burn offsets part of it.
- **Phase 2 (24+ months)**: deflation as vesting ends and burn continues.

## 9. Security and anti-attack mechanisms

### 9.1 Anti-spam tiers

| Tier | Stake required | DoD/day | Cache queries | Priority | Price multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | $0 | 5 | 50 | Low | 1.5x |
| Basic | $50 ACTI | 20 | 200 | Normal | 1.0x |
| Pro | $500 ACTI | 100 | Unlimited | High | 0.8x |
| Enterprise | $5,000 ACTI | 1,000 | Unlimited | Premium | 0.6x |

Dynamic pricing formula:

```
Final_Price = $0.10 * Complexity_Mult * Network_Load_Mult * Reputation_Mult
```

### 9.2 Anti-sybil for gateways

1. KYC/KYB + infra audit + 30-day testnet uptime.
2. DAO vote (66% approval).
3. 90-day probation with reduced rewards and slashing risk.
4. Full operator status after probation.

### 9.3 Consensus integrity

Quorum of 5 gateways:

- 2 random independent gateways
- 2 team gateways
- 1 elder gateway (top-3 by reputation)

Approval: 4/5 votes or both team + 1 independent + 1 elder.

Reputation weights:

- Uptime: 30%
- Validation accuracy: 40%
- Response latency: 15%
- Challenges won: 15%

### 9.4 Knowledge challenge system

- Challenger stakes $500 ACTI.
- 9-gateway quorum re-validates.
- If challenger correct: receives $1,000, original quorum slashed $5K each.
- If incorrect: stake forfeited.

Expiration policy:

- Factual claims: 6 months.
- Technical docs: 12 months.
- Opinion/philosophy: permanent.

## 10. Daily contributor contest

- 50% of ecosystem fund allocated: 125M tokens over 4 years.
- Daily prize pool scales with active users.

Value scoring (illustrative): novelty, complexity, reusability, factual density, consensus quality.

| Cache hit rate < 80% | Medium | High | Extended beta testing, adjust pricing | 
| Scorer LLM bias | Medium | Medium | Academic audits, DAO-controlled versioning |
| Arweave economics collapse | Low | High | Hybrid storage fallback, local cache |
| Token price volatility | High | Medium | USD-pegged pricing, floor/ceiling |
| Gateway centralization | Low | Medium | Ownership caps, decentralization schedule |

## 16. Team and governance

### 16.1 Governance model

- Governance token: staked ACTI with time-weighted voting power.
- Scope: pricing, burn rate, gateway admissions, ecosystem fund, upgrades.

Voting power:

```
Voting Power = Staked_ACTI * 2.0 * Time_Weight
```

Time weight:

- < 3 months: 0.5x
- 3-6 months: 1.0x
- 6-12 months: 1.5x
- > 12 months: 2.0x

Proposal process:

1. Draft MIP (7 days discussion).
2. Formal submission (10K ACTI bond).
3. Voting period (14 days).
4. 48h timelock before execution.
