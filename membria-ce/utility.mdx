## Crypto utility

* **Shared knowledge base:** knowledge artifacts are owned, validated, and redistributed through the DAO.
* **Usage-based token economy:** DoD payments, reuse rewards, validator staking, and governance participation use ACTI as the utility token.
* **Infrastructure activity:** contributors and gateways generate on-chain usage tied to verification and reuse rather than speculation.
* **Exchange alignment:** the user base is already token-aware, which simplifies adoption of pay-per-distill mechanics.

## Value to other industries

* **Private, compliant AI:** enterprises can run local models while referencing verified, auditable knowledge.
* **Edge + robotics + IoT:** devices gain access to a decentralized knowledge graph with low-latency retrieval.
* **Consumer AI & SMBs:** developers pay only when they need distilled knowledge, with subscriptions available for full DBB/DS.
* **Resilience & trust:** separation between model and knowledge, plus Arweave permanence and Peaq consensus, supports audit trails.
