## Security and Privacy Model

Membria CE is designed around a local-first security model.
Your data, reasoning, and decisions belong to you and remain under your control by default.

The system is built to minimize unnecessary data movement, avoid silent data reuse, and make every escalation explicit and auditable.

---

## Data Scope and Ownership

Membria does not crawl, scrape, or infer data sources automatically.

You explicitly choose:
- Which sources are connected
- What time ranges are ingested
- What content is included or excluded

Only selected data becomes part of the local reasoning context and knowledge graph.
Raw chat logs are not treated as primary storage; decisions and derived structures are preserved instead.

You retain full ownership of:
- Source data
- Derived knowledge
- Decision history
- Local embeddings and graphs

---

## Local-First Data Handling

In self-hosted and local-first modes:
- Source data stays on your device or private environment
- Reasoning and inference happen locally whenever possible
- No background synchronization occurs without explicit triggers

Local data is never silently uploaded or reused across users.

Membria is designed to function offline for core reasoning and decision capture.

---

## Escalation and External Interaction

When local models are insufficient, Membria may escalate selectively.

Escalation is:
- Triggered only by explicit confidence or risk thresholds
- Limited to the minimum context required
- Logged with timestamp, purpose, and outcome

Escalated requests never include your full workspace or raw history.
Results are validated, distilled, and stored as structured knowledge, not raw transcripts.

All escalations are visible and auditable.

---

## Decentralized Knowledge Backend

Membria may optionally use a decentralized backend for:
- Verified knowledge reuse
- Result caching
- Cross-session persistence

This backend is:
- Content-addressed
- Append-only
- Designed for verification, not inference

It does not replace local reasoning and does not act as a central AI brain.
Its role is persistence, traceability, and reuse.

---

## Access Controls and Revocation

Source access is permissioned and revocable at any time.

You can:
- Disconnect sources instantly
- Remove ingested data
- Clear derived knowledge structures
- Reset local memory and graphs

Revocation does not require system restarts or external approval.

---

## Transparency and Auditability

Membria does not hide uncertainty.

You can inspect:
- When decisions were captured
- What context was used
- Whether escalation occurred
- What assumptions were recorded

There are no silent optimizations, hidden fine-tuning, or background learning loops.

---

## What Membria Does Not Do

Membria CE does not:
- Train global models on your data
- Share your data with other users
- Optimize for advertising or engagement
- Collect behavioral analytics unrelated to product function

---

## Summary

Membria CE treats security and privacy as architectural constraints, not policy promises.

Local reasoning comes first.
Escalation is explicit.
Persistence is controlled.
Trust is earned through visibility, not abstraction.
