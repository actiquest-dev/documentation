## Competitive landscape

| Category | Projects | Core approach | Membria focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Centralized LLMs | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | Cloud-hosted models with embedded knowledge | Local execution + decentralized memory + verifiable provenance |
| RAG / knowledge systems | Pinecone, Weaviate, LangChain | Vector search + static corpora | Reusable knowledge graph with incentives + permanent storage |
| Decentralized AI | Bittensor, Fetch.ai | Decentralized compute/agents | Knowledge-first infrastructure for lightweight models |
| Local AI tooling | Ollama, LM Studio | Run models locally | Augments local models with shared memory |
| Knowledge platforms | Wikipedia | Human-curated knowledge | Machine-native, verifiable, AI-optimized artifacts |

## Differentiation

**Technological:** Model-knowledge separation, local-first inference, verifiable artifacts (Arweave + Peaq), reusable intelligence.

**Commercial:** Pay-per-distillation, cache-first cost structure, user-controlled data, open-source client, decentralized backend.

## Partnerships & strategy

### Key partners

* **R&D:** FSID, University of Amsterdam, University of Luxembourg for AI memory research.
* **Enterprise:** Mistral, Snowflake, FalkorDB, Databricks, NVIDIA (Inception program) for infrastructure + edge AI deployments.
* **Blockchain:** Arweave (storage), Peaq Protocol (coordination), Fetch.ai (knowledge enhancement and ASI Alliance).

### Exchange & liquidity plan

* Initial listing targeted on Binance Alpha with net-flat market making (in-house 33%, Coin-Alpha 23%, Wintermute/DWF Labs 43%).
* Additional exchanges (Gate.io, HTX, Crypto.com) in conversation; further listings expected once on-chain traction is proven.
* Liquidity pools on BNB Chain DEXes align with protocol-owned liquidity.

### Community & engagement

* Global reach similar to Hugging Face (US ~18%, China ~13%, India ~9%, Russia ~5%, South Korea ~4%).
* Engagement through Telegram, Twitter/X, Discord, GitHub, and a technical blog.
* Past off-chain pilot: ~40K registrations (Actiq Wallet), with geo-split (Eastern EU 49%, CIS 24%, Africa 15%, Asia 8%, Western EU 4%).

### Market makers

* Launch supported by 3–4 market makers with no single entity holding >60% allocation.
* KYB completed on Binance.com for named partners.
