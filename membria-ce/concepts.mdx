# Concepts

Membria CE is built around a small set of runtime primitives. This page summarizes them and points to the deeper docs.

## Core concepts

### Decision Surface (DS)
The Decision Surface is the user-facing layer that shows open loops, drift, and outcomes. It is derived from DBB records, not raw chat.
See [Client overview](/membria-ce/client) and [Runtime diagrams](/membria-ce/diagrams).

### Decision Black Box (DBB)
DBB is the capture engine that detects decisions and records structured evidence with confidence scores.
See [DBB and LoRA runtime](/membria-ce/dbb-and-lora-runtime) and [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime).

### ThoughtUnits and GraphRAG
ThoughtUnits are normalized fragments that feed the graph and vector layers. GraphRAG uses the temporal graph + vectors to produce explainable retrieval.
See [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime) and [Runtime diagrams](/membria-ce/diagrams).

### Cache-augmented generation (CAG)
Verified answers are cached locally and in the KCG so responses improve over time without re-computation.
See [Decentralized backend](/membria-ce/decentralized-backend) and [KCG and gateways](/membria-ce/kcg-gateways).

### Escalation and Council governance
Escalation routes queries to stronger models only when local confidence fails. The Council output is verified and written back with provenance.
See [Decentralized backend](/membria-ce/decentralized-backend), [KCG and gateways](/membria-ce/kcg-gateways), and [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime).

### LoRA adapters and SkillForge
LoRA adapters provide scoped expertise without changing the base model or rewriting history.
See [DBB and LoRA runtime](/membria-ce/dbb-and-lora-runtime).
