> Membria CE is built around a small set of runtime primitives. This page summarizes them and points to the deeper docs.

## Core concepts

### Smart Persistence Layer (Reasoning Graph)
Membria CE is built around a **personal Smart Persistence Layer for AI**. Instead of storing full chat logs, Reasoning Graph selectively captures:
- Decisions you make
- Reasoning paths you follow
- Assumptions you rely on
- Outcomes that confirm or invalidate those decisions

This allows Membria CE to act as a **second memory**, preserving how you think across time.

### Decision Surface (DS)
The Decision Surface is the user-facing layer that shows open loops, drift, and outcomes. It is derived from DBB records, not raw chat.
See [Client overview](/membria-ce/client) and [Runtime diagrams](/membria-ce/diagrams).

### Decision Black Box (DBB)
DBB is the capture engine that detects decisions and records structured evidence with confidence scores.
See [DBB and LoRA runtime](/membria-ce/dbb-and-lora-runtime) and [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime).

### Decision Intelligence Engine (DI)
The DI engine runs on top of captured decisions to optimize human focus.
- **Value of Information (VoI):** Prioritizes open loops based on the expected utility of gathering more data.
- **POMDP Belief Tracking:** Maintains a probabilistic model of team consensus to detect "hidden disagreement."
- **Decision Sequencing:** Uses a **Priority Queue** (Value/Urgency) to recommend the optimal order for decision making without opaque simulations.

### ThoughtUnits and GraphRAG
ThoughtUnits are normalized fragments that feed the graph and vector layers. GraphRAG uses the temporal graph + vectors to produce explainable retrieval.
See [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime) and [Runtime diagrams](/membria-ce/diagrams).

### Cache-augmented generation (CAG)
Verified answers are cached locally and in the KCG so responses improve over time without re-computation.
See [Decentralized backend](/membria-ce/decentralized-backend) and [KCG and gateways](/membria-ce/kcg-gateways).

### Escalation and Council governance
Escalation routes queries to stronger models only when local confidence fails. The Council output is verified and written back with provenance.
See [Decentralized backend](/membria-ce/decentralized-backend), [KCG and gateways](/membria-ce/kcg-gateways), and [Client runtime RFC](/membria-ce/client-runtime).

### Cognitive Safety Layer
A local "System 2" check that protects you from your own biases.
- **Bias Firewall:** Warns if you are falling for Confirmation Bias.
- **Resonance Detection:** Flags if the AI is just telling you what you want to hear.

### LoRA adapters and SkillForge
LoRA adapters provide scoped expertise without changing the base model or rewriting history.
See [DBB and LoRA runtime](/membria-ce/dbb-and-lora-runtime).

### Local-first reasoning
Membria CE runs local models by default. Local reasoning is enhanced through personal GraphRAG, user-specific LoRA patches, and continuous context across sessions. Escalation to stronger external models happens only when confidence thresholds are not met.

### Memory scope
In CE, all memory is private by default. Nothing is shared unless explicitly exported or synchronized by the user.
