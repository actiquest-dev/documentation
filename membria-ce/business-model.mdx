## Business model pillars

Membria CE supports **two commercial tiers**:

1. **Pay‑per‑distill (trial / lightweight):** users pay only when a DoD escalation is required, without the full Decision Surface/DBB workflow.
2. **Full subscription (DBB + DS):** always‑on client capture, Decision Surface signals, and access to backend escalations.

The guiding principle is **pay for knowledge only when needed**, while advanced users subscribe for the full decision workflow.

### Current revenue stream

| Stream | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise licensing | Membria EE (KMS + Decision Surface) custom integrations | Live; ~$200K ARR from 3 contracts |

### Planned streams

| Stream | Mechanics | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CE pay‑per‑distill | Per‑DoD request (USD‑pegged, paid in ACTI) | Trial tier; usage‑driven |
| CE full subscription | $15–20/user/month | Includes DBB + DS client workflow |
| Gateway operator economics | Revenue share, licensing, commissions | Decentralized infra revenue, staking + license sales |
| Membria GRaaS | SaaS KMS for SMBs ($20–50/user/month) | Launching Q1 2026 |
| SkillForge marketplace | Revenue share on creator modules | Long‑tail creator monetization |

### Treasury discipline

* Conservative cash focus (fiat reserves only when needed). Current treasury holds ~488M ACTI ($6.7M at $0.0137) and €80K in bank. Tokens reserved for ecosystem incentives, DAO governance, and long-term sustainability.
* Token-related incentives (DoD rewards, contributor incentives) are tracked separately and not counted as cash expenses.
