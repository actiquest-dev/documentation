> Membria CE is a personal, local-first AI system with a persistence layer. You can use it like a normal chat on day one, but it will > gradually build a private reasoning + knowledge memory from your real work.

## 1) Choose how you run Membria CE

Membria CE supports two modes:

- **Cloud (managed)**: fastest way to start. Your personal workspace is hosted, and you connect your sources.
- **Self-hosted (local)**: install and run CE locally when your package is available. Local data stays local by default.

In both modes, Membria can use a **decentralized knowledge backend** as a shared cache layer (controlled by you) so answers, citations, and extracted knowledge can persist beyond a single device.

## 2) Create your personal workspace

Create a workspace that will hold:

- your connected sources
- your personal reasoning graph (memory)
- your Decision Black Box (DBB) events
- your Decision Surface (DS)

If you plan to later migrate to self-hosted, keep your workspace name and source structure clean (it makes export or migration easier).

## 3) Connect your first source (minimum required)

Membria works best when it has at least one real source to ground on. Start with one:

- a folder of documents (PDF, DOCX, MD)
- a Drive or Dropbox connector
- a chat export (Claude, Codex, ChatGPT logs)
- a notes repository (Obsidian or Markdown)

**Tip:** Start small (last 30 to 90 days). You can expand later once you trust the signals.

## 4) Run the first ingestion

Run ingestion and wait for three outputs:

1. **Indexing** (searchable text + metadata)
2. **Graph memory seeds** (entities, links, timelines, provenance)
3. **Initial DBB candidates** (potential decision moments detected in your material)

At this stage, Membria is not trying to be smart. It is trying to be *grounded*.

## 5) Open Decision Surface (DS) and review your first signals

Decision Surface is the home screen because it shows *what matters over time*, not what was said last.

Look for:

- decisions that are **open** (not finalized)
- decisions that are **high-impact** (risk, money, deadlines, compliance)
- repeated topics with **drift** (the same thing keeps getting re-decided)

Do not aim for perfection. You are calibrating.

## 6) Confirm or dismiss DBB captures (first calibration loop)

DBB (Decision Black Box) will occasionally surface "I think a decision happened here."

Your job in week one is simple:

- **Confirm** when it really was a decision (and optionally tag outcome or intent)
- **Dismiss** when it was just discussion noise

This trains Membria's thresholds and reduces false positives without changing your workflow.

## 7) Use Chat mode normally

You can chat exactly like you do in other tools.

The difference is what happens behind the scenes:

- chats are treated as **input streams**
- Membria extracts **decisions, reasoning, assumptions, and outcomes**
- DS becomes a clean control surface over the mess of conversations

You do not need to write better prompts or adopt a new discipline for Membria to work.

## 8) What happens when local AI is not enough

When the local model is uncertain, Membria escalates in a controlled order:

1. **Local memory + GraphRAG** (your sources first)
2. **Knowledge cache lookup** (if a validated answer already exists)
3. **Council escalation** (stronger models synthesize a better answer)
4. **Caching + learning** (result is stored with provenance for reuse)

Escalations are visible, logged, and can be budget-limited.

## 9) Where LoRA fits (without you managing it)

Membria can apply **LoRA patches** to specialize your local model for domains you repeatedly work in.

In CE, LoRA is intended to:

- close recurring knowledge gaps discovered by DBB plus outcomes
- reduce escalation frequency over time
- improve consistency in your domains (without retraining the base model)

You do not have to select LoRAs manually. Membria routes them when they help and rolls them back if they degrade quality.

## 10) Next steps

- Read **Concepts** to understand DBB, DS, graph memory, Council, and caches.
- Open **Client Runtime** to see the full stack and where data lives.
- Add a second source (a different modality: docs plus chat logs is a strong combo).
- After 7 to 14 days, review DS again and mark outcomes on a few key decisions (this is when compounding starts).
