## Markets in focus

Membria CE targets three adjacent markets:

| Market | 2030 estimate | Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI infrastructure & platforms | $120–150B | Models and inference pipelines that benefit from reusable knowledge and gateways |
| Enterprise knowledge management & AI search | $35–45B | Regulated environments that require verifiable knowledge layers |
| Edge & on-device AI | $60–70B | Lightweight models that need low-latency knowledge access |

Overlap-adjusted **TAM:** ~$180–220B globally.

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

Membria focuses on organizations that use task-specific models, require auditability, and want to reduce inference/retraining costs. Primary verticals include enterprise SaaS, financial services, industrial/robotics, and autonomous workflows. **SAM:** ~$18–25B.

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Near- and mid-term SOM concentrates on:

* Enterprise pilots and infrastructure partners.
* AI agents/copilots that require recurring knowledge access.
* Infrastructure contracts rather than per-seat pricing.

With 0.5–1% penetration of the SAM and multi-year infrastructure deals, **Membria’s SOM:** ~$100–250M within three years. The consumer-facing Membria CE model monetizes DoD requests and subscriptions with usage-driven economics.
