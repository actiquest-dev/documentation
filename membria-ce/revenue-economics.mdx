## Current status

Membria operates at a controlled loss. $200K ARR from Enterprise Edition (3–5 clients, $40K–$80K contracts) covers ~80–90% of the $20K monthly OPEX; the remaining gap is intentionally filled with equity funding to keep the team lean while validation occurs.

### Enterprise unit economics (monthly)

| Category | USD |
| --- | --- |
| Revenue | ~17,000 |
| Infrastructure | ~6,000 |
| Engineering & support | ~9,000 |
| Overhead & tools | ~5,000 |
| **Total OPEX** | **~20,000** |
| **Net** | **~–3,000** |

Enterprise revenue is reinvested to subsidize CE development, build reusable knowledge, and lower CE launch risk.

## Community Edition (CE) pricing

Membria CE uses **two tiers**:

1. **Pay‑per‑distill (trial):** users pay only when a DoD escalation is required. This tier provides backend knowledge access without full DBB/DS.
2. **Full subscription:** $15–20/user/month. Includes Decision Surface + DBB client workflow plus backend escalations.

## Revenue logic (examples)

- **Subscription scenario:** 10,000 users × $17 = ~$170K/month (~$2M ARR).
- **Pay‑per‑distill scenario:** revenue scales with DoD request volume; this tier converts heavy users into subscriptions once they need DS/DBB.

## Combined trajectory

| Phase | Enterprise | Community | Total ARR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current | ~$200K | $0 | ~$200K |
| CE Beta (Year 1) | ~$250K | ~$1.2M | ~$1.45M |
| CE Scale (Year 2) | ~$300K | ~$4.5M | ~$4.8M |

CE becomes the primary growth engine; enterprise remains a stable, non-dilutive base.

## Revenue mix summary

| Stream | Pricing | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise Edition | $40K–$80K / year | Stabilizes cash, validates infrastructure |
| CE pay‑per‑distill | Per DoD request (USD‑pegged → ACTI) | Trial tier, usage‑driven |
| CE full subscription | $15–20 / user / month | Predictable scale revenue with DBB/DS |
| API/Gateway (tokenized) | Pay‑per‑use (USD pegged → ACTI) | Aligns token demand with usage |
| Enterprise custom knowledge | One-off + recurring | High-margin services for regulated clients |
| Ecosystem services | Revenue share | Long-term upside |

## Profitability outlook

* Current net: controlled loss (~$3K/month).
* CE scale (~10K users) expected to generate positive margin, with lower OPEX per user as cache reuse increases.
* Profitability is tied to cache efficiency, reuse, and hybrid/local inference adoption.
