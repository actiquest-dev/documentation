## The DBB agent

Decision Black Box runs in the client layer. It captures decision pivots across chat, notes, and local tools, then writes immutable decision records used by the Decision Surface.

1. Detects closure markers that signal a real decision.
2. Extracts context, alternatives, confidence, and predictions.
3. Writes an immutable decision record (append-only outcomes later).

DBB is silent and non-interruptive. It does not trigger backend escalation unless the client needs external knowledge.

## Why it exists

Without DBB, decision context is scattered across logs. With DBB, decisions are stored as structured, immutable records and can be queried as signals on the Decision Surface.
