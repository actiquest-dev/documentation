## Signal stack (client layer)

Decision Surface consumes DBB records only. It surfaces:

- **Open loops:** unresolved decisions or conflicting assumptions.
- **Drift cards:** assumption changes after a decision.
- **Pending outcomes:** reminders to append reality vs. prediction.
- **Track record:** accuracy by domain over time.

## When the backend is involved

If a client query needs external verification, the Decision Surface requests a DoD escalation from the backend layer (KCG + gateways). The backend returns a verified knowledge payload that the client can reference without altering the original decision record.
