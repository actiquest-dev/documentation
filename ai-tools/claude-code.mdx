## Council escalation

When the client cannot answer confidently, it triggers a DoD escalation to the backend. A council of specialized models reviews the request, generates verified knowledge, and writes the resulting payload into the KCG (Peaq logic + Arweave storage).

## Token incentives (backend layer)

Tokens are intended to reward validated knowledge events, not raw activity. The backend layer:

- Issues tokens for verified distillation events.
- Rewards reuse of high-quality artifacts.
- Applies staking and slashing for validators and curators.

## Spam resistance

- Closure markers ensure only real decisions are captured.
- Cross-source corroboration strengthens confidence.
- Time separation prevents duplicate decisions.
- Provenance-first metadata links each claim to evidence.
