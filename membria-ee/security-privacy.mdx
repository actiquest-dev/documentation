# Security and privacy

This page describes the security architecture, privacy guarantees, and compliance controls of **Membria EE (Enterprise Edition)**.

Membria EE is designed for organizations operating in regulated environments where data integrity, auditability, and residency are mandatory.

---

## Security model overview

Membria EE follows a **defense-in-depth** model across infrastructure, data, identity, and runtime layers.

Core principles:
- Customer data is isolated by default
- Access is explicit, logged, and auditable
- No silent learning or cross-tenant reuse
- Security controls are enforceable, not advisory

Membria does not rely on implicit trust in AI models or operators.

---

## Identity and access controls

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Membria EE supports enterprise identity providers via:
- SAML 2.0
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)

This enables centralized authentication aligned with corporate IAM policies.

### SCIM provisioning

Automated user lifecycle management via SCIM:
- User creation and deactivation
- Role assignment
- Group synchronization

This ensures access is always aligned with HR and identity systems.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

Access is governed by fine-grained roles, including:
- Workspace administrators
- Knowledge contributors
- Read-only and audit roles
- System and compliance officers

Privileges are enforced at query, ingestion, and escalation levels.

---

## Data encryption

### Encryption at rest

All stored data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms:
- AES-256 for storage volumes
- Encrypted vector indices
- Encrypted knowledge graph stores

Encryption keys are managed via enterprise-grade key management systems (KMS).

### Encryption in transit

All data in transit is protected using:
- TLS 1.2+ for all internal and external communication
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal service-to-service traffic (where applicable)

No plaintext data is transmitted between components.

---

## Data isolation and tenancy

### Tenant isolation

Each Membria EE deployment operates in a **fully isolated environment**:
- Dedicated compute
- Dedicated storage
- Dedicated vector and graph databases

No multi-tenant inference or shared memory is used.

### Knowledge isolation

- Knowledge graphs are private by default
- No cross-organization knowledge sharing
- No training or fine-tuning on customer data without explicit approval

This applies to:
- local models
- escalation paths
- knowledge caches

---

## Data residency and retention

### Data residency

Membria EE supports region-specific deployments to meet regulatory requirements:
- On-premise
- Private cloud
- Approved geographic regions

All data, including backups and logs, remains within the configured region.

### Retention policies

Organizations can configure:
- Data retention periods
- Log retention durations
- Deletion and archival rules

Retention policies are enforced automatically and auditable.

---

## Auditability and logging

### Full audit logs

Membria EE maintains immutable audit logs for:
- User access
- Query execution
- Decision capture
- Escalations to external models
- Administrative actions

Logs include:
- Actor identity
- Timestamp
- Action type
- Affected resources

### Escalation transparency

Any escalation beyond local models is:
- Explicitly logged
- Traceable to a specific request
- Attributable to a user or system policy

There are no silent escalations.

---

## Compliance posture

Membria EE is designed to support compliance with frameworks such as:
- GDPR
- SOC 2 (Type I / II alignment)
- ISO 27001 (control mapping)
- Financial and banking regulations (AML, KYC, SOX-aligned workflows)

Formal certifications depend on deployment scope and customer requirements.

---

## What Membria does not do

For clarity, Membria EE does **not**:
- Train global models on customer data
- Share embeddings or graphs across tenants
- Perform background learning without consent
- Hide model behavior or decision provenance

Security behavior is explicit and inspectable.

---

## Key takeaway

Membria EE treats AI as a regulated system component, not a black box.

Security, privacy, and compliance are enforced through architecture, not policy documents.
