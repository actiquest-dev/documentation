> Core enterprise concepts and governance model for Membria Enterprise Edition (EE).
> Membria EE is designed for organizations operating in regulated, high-risk, and high-complexity environments.
> Its core concepts reflect how knowledge, decisions, and reasoning must be handled in enterprise contexts.

## Enterprise Smart Persistence Layer (Reasoning Graph)

Membria EE deploys Reasoning Graph as an **enterprise-grade reasoning backbone**. Reasoning Graph in EE stores:
- Decisions
- Policies
- Assumptions
- Evidence
- Temporal relationships

All data remains within the enterprise boundary and adheres to residency and compliance constraints.

---

## Private Knowledge Domains and Tenancy

Membria EE operates on the principle of **explicit knowledge boundaries**.

A **Knowledge Domain** is a logically isolated space that defines:
- What data is accessible
- Which models and LoRA patches apply
- Who can see, query, or influence decisions
- How escalation and retention policies behave

Domains may correspond to:
- Business units
- Legal entities
- Jurisdictions
- Projects or regulatory scopes

**Key properties:**
- Strict isolation by default (no cross-domain leakage)
- Optional controlled sharing via policy
- Independent retention and deletion rules
- Independent audit trails

This allows enterprises to run multiple regulated contexts inside a single deployment without risk of contamination.

## Policy-Driven Escalation and Cost Controls

All non-local reasoning in Membria EE is governed by **explicit policies**, not hidden heuristics.

Escalation policies define:
- When local inference is sufficient
- When external or stronger models may be used
- Which models are allowed per domain
- Cost ceilings and token budgets
- Risk thresholds that force escalation or block it

**Important characteristics:**
- Escalation is opt-in, not mandatory
- Policies can enforce fully local operation
- Cost exposure is predictable and bounded
- Every escalation is logged and reviewable

This ensures that enterprises remain in control of:
- Spend
- Risk
- Data exposure
- Model behavior

## Compliance-Grade Audit Trails

Membria EE treats reasoning and decisions as **first-class audit objects**.

Audit trails capture:
- What information was used
- Which assumptions were present
- Which models participated
- What decision or conclusion was produced
- Who accessed or approved outputs
- When changes occurred

**Properties:**
- Append-only
- Tamper-evident
- Time-indexed
- Queryable for compliance and forensic review

Audit data is retained according to enterprise-defined policies and supports regulatory requirements such as:
- SOX
- AML/KYC
- GDPR accountability
- Internal risk management

---

## Security Review and Approval Workflows

Membria EE supports **human-in-the-loop governance** where required.

Security and approval workflows allow organizations to:
- Require approval before certain escalations
- Review high-impact decisions
- Gate access to sensitive knowledge domains
- Enforce separation of duties

Typical use cases include:
- Compliance sign-off before regulatory interpretation
- Legal review of contract reasoning
- Risk committee approval for sensitive decisions

These workflows integrate directly into the Decision Surface and audit system, ensuring that governance does not rely on external tools or informal processes.

---

## Enterprise Decision Intelligence (DI) & Strategic Alignment

Membria EE incorporates the **Decision Intelligence Engine** to bridge the gap between tactical interaction and strategic risk management.

- **Strategic Value of Information (VoI):** Evaluates open decisions across the entire enterprise. It identifies which "Open Loops" have the highest strategic utility and risk exposure, allowing leadership to prioritize focus on high-stakes unresolved items.
- **Cross-Domain Alignment (POMDP):** Large organizations often suffer from "Surface Consensus." The DI engine tracks the belief states across different business units (Knowledge Domains) to detect latent misalignment or "Hidden Divergence" even when formal approvals are in place.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Sequencing (Priority Queue):** Instead of computationally expensive tree search (MCTS), EE uses a robust **Priority Queue** to order decisions. It scores potential "next moves" by their Value of Information (VoI) and Urgency, unlocking bottlenecks (Critical Path) with O(N log N) predictability.

---

### Policy-Governed Memory Activation

Critical decisions can require:
- Human approval
- Multi-party review
- Explicit sign-off before becoming persistent memory

This allows Reasoning Graph to operate safely in regulated environments.

---

## Enterprise Cognitive Safety Layer

For regulated industries, "AI Hallucinations" are not just errors—they are liabilities. Membria EE implements a **System 2 Safety Layer** that actively monitors reasoning for cognitive biases.

### 1. Resonance Detection & Bias Firewall
If an AI model agrees with a user too quickly (Resonance Score > 0.6) or exhibits known cognitive biases (Confirmation Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy), the system intervenes.
- **Trigger:** High semantic similarity between user prompt and AI response + top-choice logit dominance.
- **Action:** Forced "Devil's Advocate" check or Human-in-the-loop review.

### 2. Debiasing Interventions
The system injects mandatory "System 2" pauses into the workflow:
- **Anchoring Check:** "You are basing this heavily on the first number cited ($5M). Have you considered the alternative scenarios?"
- **Pre-Mortem:** "Before approving, list 3 reasons this decision could fail."

This ensures that AI serves as a check on human reasoning, not just an amplifier of it.

---

### Design Principles

Membria EE concepts are guided by the following principles:

- **Isolation before sharing**
- **Policies over heuristics**
- **Auditability over convenience**
- **Safety over speed (System 2)**
- **Explicit governance over implicit behavior**
- **Local-first by default**

These principles ensure Membria EE can be deployed in environments where trust, compliance, and accountability are non-negotiable.

---

## Summary

Membria EE is not just an AI deployment.
It is a **governed reasoning system** designed to operate safely inside enterprise constraints.

Its core concepts enable organizations to:
- Accumulate intelligence without losing control
- Scale reasoning without scaling risk
- Use AI without violating compliance boundaries
