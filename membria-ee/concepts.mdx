> Core enterprise concepts and governance model for Membria Enterprise Edition (EE).
> Membria EE is designed for organizations operating in regulated, high-risk, and high-complexity environments.
> Its core concepts reflect how knowledge, decisions, and reasoning must be handled in enterprise contexts.

## Enterprise Smart Persistence Layer (Reasoning Graph)

Membria EE deploys Reasoning Graph as an **enterprise-grade reasoning backbone**. Reasoning Graph in EE stores:
- Decisions
- Policies
- Assumptions
- Evidence
- Temporal relationships

All data remains within the enterprise boundary and adheres to residency and compliance constraints.

---

## Private Knowledge Domains and Tenancy

Membria EE operates on the principle of **explicit knowledge boundaries**.

A **Knowledge Domain** is a logically isolated space that defines:
- What data is accessible
- Which models and LoRA patches apply
- Who can see, query, or influence decisions
- How escalation and retention policies behave

Domains may correspond to:
- Business units
- Legal entities
- Jurisdictions
- Projects or regulatory scopes

**Key properties:**
- Strict isolation by default (no cross-domain leakage)
- Optional controlled sharing via policy
- Independent retention and deletion rules
- Independent audit trails

This allows enterprises to run multiple regulated contexts inside a single deployment without risk of contamination.

## Policy-Driven Escalation and Cost Controls

All non-local reasoning in Membria EE is governed by **explicit policies**, not hidden heuristics.

Escalation policies define:
- When local inference is sufficient
- When external or stronger models may be used
- Which models are allowed per domain
- Cost ceilings and token budgets
- Risk thresholds that force escalation or block it

**Important characteristics:**
- Escalation is opt-in, not mandatory
- Policies can enforce fully local operation
- Cost exposure is predictable and bounded
- Every escalation is logged and reviewable

This ensures that enterprises remain in control of:
- Spend
- Risk
- Data exposure
- Model behavior

## Compliance-Grade Audit Trails

Membria EE treats reasoning and decisions as **first-class audit objects**.

Audit trails capture:
- What information was used
- Which assumptions were present
- Which models participated
- What decision or conclusion was produced
- Who accessed or approved outputs
- When changes occurred

**Properties:**
- Append-only
- Tamper-evident
- Time-indexed
- Queryable for compliance and forensic review

Audit data is retained according to enterprise-defined policies and supports regulatory requirements such as:
- SOX
- AML/KYC
- GDPR accountability
- Internal risk management

---

## Security Review and Approval Workflows

Membria EE supports **human-in-the-loop governance** where required.

Security and approval workflows allow organizations to:
- Require approval before certain escalations
- Review high-impact decisions
- Gate access to sensitive knowledge domains
- Enforce separation of duties

Typical use cases include:
- Compliance sign-off before regulatory interpretation
- Legal review of contract reasoning
- Risk committee approval for sensitive decisions

These workflows integrate directly into the Decision Surface and audit system, ensuring that governance does not rely on external tools or informal processes.

---

### Policy-Governed Memory Activation

Critical decisions can require:
- Human approval
- Multi-party review
- Explicit sign-off before becoming persistent memory

This allows Reasoning Graph to operate safely in regulated environments.

### Design Principles

Membria EE concepts are guided by the following principles:

- **Isolation before sharing**
- **Policies over heuristics**
- **Auditability over convenience**
- **Explicit governance over implicit behavior**
- **Local-first by default**

These principles ensure Membria EE can be deployed in environments where trust, compliance, and accountability are non-negotiable.

---

## Summary

Membria EE is not just an AI deployment.
It is a **governed reasoning system** designed to operate safely inside enterprise constraints.

Its core concepts enable organizations to:
- Accumulate intelligence without losing control
- Scale reasoning without scaling risk
- Use AI without violating compliance boundaries
