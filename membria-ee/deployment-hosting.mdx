> Membria EE is deployed **entirely within customer-controlled infrastructure**.
> It is designed for regulated enterprise environments where data residency, security boundaries, and operational control are mandatory.  
> No data is sent to public cloud services or external APIs unless explicitly configured by the customer.
> This document describes **how Membria EE is deployed, scaled, and operated**, independent of specific business use cases.

## Deployment model

Membria EE supports the following deployment modes:

- **On-premise (primary)**  
  Deployed inside the customer’s data center.

- **Private cloud**  
  Deployed in a customer-owned private cloud (VMware, OpenStack, bare metal Kubernetes).

Public multi-tenant SaaS deployment is **not supported** for Membria EE.

### Trust boundary

All components operate within a single, clearly defined trust boundary:

- Models
- Data
- Graph storage
- Logs
- Audit trails

No external calls are required for normal operation.

---

## Runtime architecture overview

Membria EE is deployed as a **modular Kubernetes-based system** with clear separation between:

- Stateless orchestration components
- Stateful persistence layers
- Optional deep-reasoning engines

### Core runtime components

| Component | Type | Scaling model | Notes |
|---------|-----|---------------|------|
| Router | Stateless | Horizontal | Request classification, policy checks |
| Planner | Stateless | Horizontal | Task planning and tool selection |
| Fast reasoning runtime | Semi-stateless | Horizontal | Primary execution tier |
| Deep reasoning engine (optional) | Isolated | Vertical | Gated, low-volume |
| Graph store | Stateful | Sharded | Persistent memory and causality |
| Vector index | Stateful | Sharded | Embedded within graph |
| Cache | Stateful | Replicated | Semantic and result caching |
| Policy engine | Stateless | Horizontal | RBAC, DLP, escalation control |

Each component can be independently scaled or disabled depending on operational needs.

---

## Model execution tiers

Membria EE separates model execution into **explicit tiers** to control cost, latency, and risk.

### Tier 1: Fast local reasoning (default)

- Handles the majority of requests
- Optimized for low latency
- Can run on CPU or GPU
- Supports domain-specific LoRA adapters

This tier is sufficient for most enterprise workloads.

### Tier 2: Deep reasoning (optional)

- Used only for complex cases
- Explicitly gated by policy
- Deployed as a separate isolated runtime
- Can be fully disabled

Enterprises may operate Membria EE **without Tier 2 enabled**.

### Tier 3: External escalation (disabled by default)

- Optional integration point
- Requires explicit approval
- Fully auditable
- Off by default in regulated environments

---

## Persistence and data plane

### Smart Persistence Layer (SPL)

At the core of Membria EE is the Smart Persistence Layer, responsible for:

- Storing decisions and outcomes
- Preserving causality and timelines
- Linking reasoning to sources and actors

This layer is **stateful and persistent**.

### Graph-based memory

Membria EE uses a **temporal event graph** as its primary persistence model.

Key properties:

- Events are immutable
- History is preserved
- Causality is explicit
- Versioning is native

### Embedded vector indexing

Vector embeddings are stored **inside graph nodes**, not in a separate external database.

Benefits:

- RBAC and security apply automatically
- Versioning and provenance are preserved
- Retrieval is constrained to authorized subgraphs
- No synchronization drift between graph and vectors

---

## Infrastructure requirements (reference)

The following configuration is a **non-binding reference example** for a medium-scale enterprise deployment.

Actual sizing depends on:
- Data volume
- Concurrency
- Enabled components
- Retention policies

### Reference cluster layout

| Layer | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| Control plane | Kubernetes management |
| CPU workers | Router, Planner, fast reasoning |
| GPU workers | Optional deep reasoning |
| Storage nodes | Graph, vectors, metadata |
| Cache layer | Semantic and result caching |

### Example reference sizing

| Resource | Example value |
|-------|---------------|
| Total nodes | 12–18 |
| CPU cores | ~200 |
| RAM | ~450 GB |
| GPU | Optional (4× H100 or equivalent) |
| Persistent storage | 10–20 TB |
| Concurrent users | ~2,000 |

These figures are provided for planning purposes only.

## High availability and resilience

Membria EE supports standard enterprise HA patterns:

- Stateless components run with multiple replicas
- Stateful services support replication
- Leader election is automatic
- No single point of failure

### Failure handling

- Component-level restart
- Rolling upgrades
- Blue-green deployment
- Instant rollback for stateless layers

---

## Security boundary

Security is enforced at multiple layers:

- Network isolation
- RBAC enforcement
- Policy-driven execution
- Data masking and DLP
- Immutable audit logging

### Data protection

- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Customer-managed keys (optional HSM)
- Configurable retention policies

### Auditability

All access, escalation, and decision capture events are logged:

- Who accessed what
- When
- Under which policy
- With which outcome

Audit logs are immutable and exportable.

---

## Integration with enterprise systems

Membria EE integrates with existing systems through controlled interfaces:

| Integration type | Method |
|------------------|-------|
| Real-time queries | REST |
| Batch ingestion | ETL |
| Streaming events | Kafka / message bus |
| Legacy systems | REST or SOAP via ESB |

No direct database access is required.

---

## Operations and lifecycle

### Deployment lifecycle

1. Infrastructure provisioning
2. Core runtime deployment
3. Policy configuration
4. Source integration
5. Validation and acceptance

### Upgrades

- Rolling upgrades supported
- No downtime for stateless components
- Stateful upgrades follow controlled migration paths

### Monitoring

Standard enterprise observability tools are supported:

- Metrics
- Logs
- Traces
- Health probes

---

## Summary

Membria EE is deployed as a **self-contained, on-premise reasoning platform**.

It provides:
- Full data residency
- Explicit trust boundaries
- Modular execution tiers
- Persistent institutional memory
- Enterprise-grade operational control

The deployment model is designed to integrate cleanly into existing regulated environments without introducing external dependencies.
