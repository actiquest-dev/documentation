# Getting started (Membria EE)

Membria EE is designed for regulated, high-trust environments where data ownership, auditability, and governance come first.

Enterprise onboarding focuses on **alignment, control, and validation** before any large-scale ingestion begins.

This is intentional: Membria EE is not a plug-and-play chatbot, but an institutional intelligence system.

---

## 1) Align on deployment and trust boundaries

Before installation, align on the operating model:

- **Deployment**: on-prem, private cloud, or isolated VPC
- **Data residency**: country, region, retention requirements
- **Trust boundary**: what stays fully local vs what may interact with external systems
- **Escalation policy**: whether multi-model escalation is allowed and under which conditions

At this stage, Membria EE is configured to match the organization's existing risk posture.
No data is ingested yet.

---

## 2) Configure identity, access, and tenancy

Membria EE integrates with enterprise identity systems.

Typical setup includes:

- SSO (SAML / OIDC)
- Role and group mapping
- Workspace and domain separation
- Approval roles for governance actions (LoRA, escalation, policy changes)

This ensures that:
- access is explicit
- ownership is clear
- every action is attributable

---

## 3) Define governance and policy controls

Before connecting data, define:

- escalation thresholds and budgets
- allowed model classes (local only, private LLMs, council-based escalation)
- audit log retention policies
- approval workflows for model changes and expert adapters

These policies are enforced automatically by the runtime.

---

## 4) Connect enterprise sources (pilot scope)

Start with a **limited, representative scope**:

- one or two core document systems
- a constrained time range
- a single business domain

Validate:
- access correctness
- provenance tracking
- audit log completeness
- policy enforcement

Avoid full ingestion until this pilot scope is trusted.

---

## 5) Run initial ingestion and validation

Initial ingestion focuses on correctness, not speed.

You should verify:

- document coverage matches expectations
- decision extraction does not over-trigger
- no cross-domain data leakage
- audit trails are complete and immutable

This phase establishes baseline confidence.

---

## 6) Review Decision Surface with stakeholders

Open the Decision Surface with domain owners, compliance, and IT.

Look for:

- detected decision clusters
- unresolved or high-risk areas
- duplicated or conflicting policies
- visibility gaps

This is often the first moment where organizations see their institutional thinking clearly.

---

## 7) Calibrate DBB for your organization

Decision Black Box (DBB) heuristics are calibrated per organization.

Early steps include:

- confirming real decisions
- dismissing false positives
- tagging outcomes where known

This tuning dramatically improves signal quality over time.

---

## 8) Enable controlled expansion

Once pilot validation is complete:

- expand to additional sources
- increase historical range
- enable additional domains
- introduce expert LoRA workflows (if approved)

At this point, Membria EE begins functioning as a persistent institutional memory.

---

## What success looks like

After onboarding:

- decisions are traceable
- reasoning is explainable
- audits are faster
- repeated mistakes decrease
- AI answers reference *your* institutional history, not generic patterns

Membria EE does not change how people work.
It changes what the organization **remembers**.

---

## Next steps

- Review **Concepts** for enterprise governance and memory models
- Review **Security and privacy** for compliance posture
- Review **Licensing** for open vs proprietary components
- Coordinate a staged rollout plan with domain owners
