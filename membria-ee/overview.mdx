# Overview

## What is Membria EE and who it serves

## Membria EE (Enterprise Edition)

Membria EE is an on-premise AI reasoning platform designed for enterprises operating under strict compliance, data residency, and security requirements.

It provides a controlled environment where human and AI-assisted decisions can be captured, preserved, and reviewed over time -- without relying on public cloud models or shared knowledge layers.

Membria EE is not a chatbot and not a document management system.
It is a **reasoning and decision infrastructure** that integrates with existing enterprise tools rather than replacing them.

---

## Who it is for

Membria EE is built for organizations where:

- data is regulated or sensitive by default,
- AI usage must be explainable, reviewable, and auditable,
- decisions must remain traceable years after they are made.

Typical users include:

- banks and financial institutions,
- telecommunications providers,
- regulated enterprises running internal AI initiatives,
- organizations with strict governance, risk, or model-risk management requirements.

---

## What problems it addresses

Enterprises already make critical decisions across many systems:

- chats and internal messengers,
- tickets and incident tools,
- documents and knowledge bases,
- internal copilots and AI assistants,
- analytics and reporting platforms.

What is usually missing is a **persistent layer that preserves why decisions were made**, not just what happened.

Membria EE fills this gap by extracting and structuring decisions, assumptions, and reasoning from existing workflows and interactions.

### Private knowledge domains

- Organization-scoped reasoning graphs
- Explicit separation between teams, domains, and projects
- No cross-tenant or cross-organization leakage

### Private Council and cache controls

- Controlled escalation to approved internal or external models
- Enterprise-owned knowledge cache
- Full visibility into when, why, and how escalation occurs

### Enterprise governance and auditability

- Clear causality between inputs, reasoning, and outcomes
- Support for audits, compliance reviews, and post-incident analysis

---

## What Membria EE does not do

- It does not replace existing chat tools, ticketing systems, or document platforms.
- It does not train global or shared models on enterprise data.
- It does not introduce autonomous decision-making without human oversight.

Membria EE operates as a **governed reasoning layer**, not as an autonomous agent.

---

## Positioning summary

Membria EE enables enterprises to use AI **without losing control over reasoning, accountability, or institutional memory**.

It turns fragmented AI usage into a coherent, auditable decision system.
