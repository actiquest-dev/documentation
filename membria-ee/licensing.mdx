description: "Open-source vs commercial components in Membria Enterprise Edition."
---
> This document describes what is open source and what is commercially licensed in Membria Enterprise Edition (EE).
> Membria EE is designed to be deployable in regulated, on-premise environments while keeping core infrastructure transparent and auditable.

---

## Licensing overview

Membria EE follows a **hybrid licensing model**:

- **Core infrastructure is open source**
- **Reasoning, decision intelligence, and governance layers are proprietary**
- **No license is required for basic deployment**
- **Commercial licenses apply to advanced decision systems and enterprise features**

This separation allows enterprises to inspect, audit, and operate the core system independently, while licensing higher-level intelligence components as needed.

---

## Open-source components (free)

The following components are open source and can be used, modified, and deployed without a commercial license.

### 1. Membria EE core platform

Includes:

- Core runtime and orchestration
- Ingestion pipelines (documents, chats, logs, structured sources)
- Vector storage and indexing
- Graph storage integration (e.g., FalkorDB or compatible graph stores)
- Base GraphRAG execution engine
- Local model inference integration
- Basic API and CLI interfaces

**Purpose:** provides a transparent, auditable foundation for knowledge ingestion and retrieval.

**License:** open source (license specified in repository, e.g., Apache 2.0 or equivalent)

---

### 2. Storage and infrastructure layer

Includes:

- Graph schema definitions
- Embedding storage and retrieval logic
- Event ingestion framework
- Basic provenance metadata (timestamps, source IDs)

**Purpose:** allows enterprises to fully control where and how data is stored and processed.

---

### 3. Self-hosted deployment

- On-premise deployment
- Air-gapped environments
- Custom infrastructure (bare metal, private cloud, sovereign cloud)

No license is required to deploy or operate Membria EE Core.

---

## Commercial and licensed components (paid)

The following components are **proprietary** and require a commercial Membria EE license.

---

### 4. Decision Surface (DS)

**What it is:**

- The Decision Surface is the primary enterprise UI and reasoning layer.
- It surfaces:
  - open decisions
  - assumption drift
  - conflicting reasoning
  - unresolved or high-risk areas
- Provides longitudinal views across time, teams, and systems.

**Why it is licensed:**

- Encodes proprietary reasoning models
- Includes enterprise-grade visualization logic
- Implements decision lifecycle semantics

**License scope:**

- Per deployment
- May be limited by number of users or nodes (contractual)

---

### 5. Decision Black Box (DBB)

**What it is:**

- An autonomous reasoning agent that detects, extracts, and records decisions from:
  - chats
  - documents
  - workflows
  - system events
- Acts as a black-box recorder for organizational decisions.

**Why it is licensed:**

- Contains proprietary heuristics and confidence models
- Includes false-positive suppression logic
- Implements decision lineage and causality tracking

**License scope:**

- Required for decision capture and long-term reasoning
- Mandatory for regulated decision workflows

---

### 6. Skill-Forge (LoRA lifecycle and governance)

**What it is:**

- Management layer for domain-specific LoRA patches
- Includes:
  - routing policies
  - evaluation datasets
  - promotion and rollback logic
  - drift and degradation detection

**Why it is licensed:**

- Encodes proprietary expertise-compounding mechanisms
- Critical for maintaining model reliability over time
- Governs how expertise accumulates safely

---

### 7. Policy-controlled escalation and Council orchestration

**What it is:**

- Optional escalation framework for:
  - multi-model reasoning
  - expert consensus synthesis
- Can be fully local, hybrid, or disabled.

**Why it is licensed:**

- Includes cost, risk, and confidence-based routing
- Provides auditability and replay guarantees
- Integrates with enterprise governance controls

---

### 8. Enterprise governance and compliance features

Includes:

- Full audit logs for reasoning and escalations
- Decision replay and forensic inspection
- Governance APIs
- Compliance reporting exports
- Policy enforcement mechanisms

These features are licensed as part of Membria EE.

---

## What is not licensed

The following are explicitly **not restricted**:

- Choice of local LLM or SLM
- Custom models trained by the customer
- External tools and integrations built by the customer
- Internal extensions built on top of the open-source core

Membria does **not** claim ownership over customer data, models, or derived knowledge.

---

## Licensing philosophy

Membria EE licensing is based on the following principles:

- **Infrastructure should be inspectable**
- **Reasoning systems are intellectual property**
- **Enterprises should choose how much intelligence to activate**
- **Nothing critical is hidden behind a black box**

You can run Membria EE Core without any paid components.
You license Membria EE when you want **decision intelligence, continuity, and governance**.
