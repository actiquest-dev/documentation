## Project overview

Actiquest Labs builds the Membria Suite: human-centered AI systems, LLM hyper-personalization, and a decentralized memory graph. Membria CE separates **client-side decision capture** from **backend knowledge infrastructure**:

- **Client layer:** Decision Surface + DBB (captures decision records locally).
- **Backend layer:** KCG + DoD + Peaq + Arweave (council escalation, graph logic, immutable storage).

## Off-chain Membria user evidence

| Segment | Platform | Scale | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local LLM developers | Hugging Face | **1.2M+** | Core Membria CE audience (model uploads, LoRA, Spaces) |
| Open-source adoption | LLaMA ecosystem | **1B+ downloads** | Indicates demand for local inference |
| Organizations | Hugging Face | **10K+ orgs** | Enterprise and research usage, future enterprise anchors |
| Contributors | GitHub (LLMs) | **100K+** | Knowledge creators for Membria protocols |
| AI power users | Reddit / Discord | 100K–300K | Early adopters tuning local models |
| AI × Crypto overlap | Hugging Face + Web3 | Growing | Users aligned with tokenized incentives |

### Crypto relevance summary

Membria’s user base is infrastructure-native and token-aware. The backend utility token (BNB Chain) is used for DoD payments, gateway staking, DAO governance, and reusable knowledge rewards.
