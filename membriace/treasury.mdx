## Dual-flow economics

Membria separates fiat/stablecoin cashflow (operating treasury) from token flow (ACTI). CE has two revenue modes:

1. **Pay‑per‑distill (trial):** users pay only when a DoD escalation is required.
2. **Full subscription:** $15–20/user/month for DBB + DS plus backend escalations.

Both modes are USD‑pegged; protocol‑level operations are internally priced in ACTI with a USD conversion.

## DoD pricing and distribution

- **Target DoD price:** $0.10 per request.
- **Conversion:** `Fee_in_ACTI = $0.10 / Current_ACTI_Price`.
- **Distribution:** 25% burn, 60% gateway commission, 10% consensus, 5% ecosystem fund.

## Token burn

* 25% of every DoD‑related ACTI fee is burned protocol‑enforced and proportional to usage.
* Example (10K subscribers, $17/mo, 15% paid DoD): monthly revenue ~$170K; monthly protocol revenue ~$225K; monthly burn ~$56K (16.9M ACTI/year, ~3.4% supply). Burn scales with usage automatically.

## Operating costs (Year 1 cloud-heavy)

| Category | Monthly USD |
| --- | --- |
| Modal inference & LoRA | $180K–$220K |
| GraphRAG (TuGraph + GPU) | $40K–$60K |
| Team-operated Gateways | $40K |
| Backend/orchestration | $15K |
| Security/monitoring/compliance | $10K |
| **Total OPEX** | **$285K–$345K** |

Costs are covered by subscription revenue and fiat treasury; early spend builds knowledge assets while cache hits improve.

## Treasury → token loop

More users → more DoD usage → more ACTI burned → lower circulating supply → stronger staking demand → healthier token economics. Treasury avoids token speculation; conversions are infrequent, planned, and DAO‑approved.

## Runway & projection

* Aim to keep 9–12 months runway in fiat/stablecoins.
* 24‑month forecast (2K→25K users) shows cumulative revenue ~$5.9M, infrastructure OPEX ~$6.6M, treasury drawdown ~$700K, leaving ~ $950K buffer. ~108–115M ACTI burned (~21–23% supply).
* Break-even expected months 16–18 as cache hits rise, inference shifts local, and hybrid costs drop.

Membria uses treasury discipline instead of token sales to pay for infra. The model targets operating break-even while reinforcing long-term deflationary token dynamics.
