Membria CE

Decision Black Box (DBB) Heuristics & LoRA Router Policy

Status: Draft
Audience: Core engineering, AI infra, platform architects
Scope: Runtime decision detection, confidence scoring, LoRA selection & escalation

---

## 1. Decision Black Box (DBB)

### 1.1 Purpose

Decision Black Box (DBB) is a backend reasoning agent responsible for:
- Detecting decisions, not conversations
- Extracting reasoning context at the moment decisions happen
- Preserving causal structure for Decision Surface (DS)
- Operating silently without interrupting user workflows

DBB is not a UX feature. It is an inference-time system that turns noisy interaction streams into durable decision records.

---

## 2. DBB Input Streams

DBB consumes multiple user-originated streams:
- AI chat conversations (Membria, Claude, Codex, etc.)
- Code commits / diffs
- Documents and notes
- Task descriptions
- Explicit user actions (accept, reject, deploy, merge)

All streams are treated as unstructured signals.

---

## 3. Decision Detection Heuristics

DBB does not rely on a single classifier. It uses heuristic composition with confidence scoring.

### 3.1 Decision Signal Types

Each detected event is evaluated across the following dimensions:

| Signal type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Commitment language | "We will", "Let's do", "I'm going with", "Final decision" |
| Irreversibility | Actions that create cost or lock-in (deploy, merge, pay, publish) |
| Alternatives closure | Explicit rejection of other options |
| Temporal anchoring | References to deadlines, timelines, next steps |
| Responsibility assertion | "I decided", "We agreed", "I approve" |
| Execution trigger | Follow-up tasks, code changes, calendar events |

Each signal contributes partial evidence, never binary truth.

---

## 4. Confidence Scoring Model

DBB assigns a Decision Confidence Score (DCS) in [0.0 - 1.0].

### 4.1 Scoring Formula (Conceptual)

DCS = sum(weight_i * signal_i) - ambiguity_penalty

Where:
- signal_i in [0,1]
- weights are user-calibrated over time
- ambiguity penalty increases with:
  - speculative language
  - conditional phrasing
  - hypothetical tense

### 4.2 Confidence Bands

| DCS range | Classification | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| >= 0.75 | Confirmed decision | Recorded immediately in DBB |
| 0.45 - 0.75 | Tentative decision | Stored as provisional, surfaced softly |
| < 0.45 | Exploration | Ignored for DS, kept only as context |

DBB never blocks user actions regardless of confidence.

---

## 5. False Positive Handling (No-Friction Model)

DBB assumes false positives are inevitable.

### 5.1 Correction Loop

Tentative decisions appear in DS as low-priority signals. User can:
- Confirm
- Mark as exploration
- Ignore

All actions are one-click, async, and avoid modal dialogs.

### 5.2 Learning Rule

Corrections:
- Adjust user-specific weights
- Improve future DCS calibration
- Are never shared globally

---

## 6. DBB Output Schema (Abstract)

Each recorded decision includes:
- Decision ID
- Timestamp
- Confidence score
- Reasoning trace (summarized, structured)
- Source references (chat IDs, commit hashes, docs)
- Assumptions detected
- Initial prediction (if available)

Decisions are append-only. No overwrites.

---

## 7. Relationship to Decision Surface (DS)

- DS reads only DBB outputs
- Raw chat history is never surfaced directly
- DS reflects:
  - Open decisions
  - Drift
  - Unresolved assumptions
  - Outcome deltas

DBB is the sole authority on what counts as a decision.

# Part II - LoRA Router Policy

## 8. Purpose of LoRA Routing

Membria does not rely on a single monolithic model. Instead:
- A base SLM handles most interactions
- LoRA adapters provide domain expertise
- Escalation occurs only when confidence is insufficient

Goal: maximize speed and personalization without hallucination.

---

## 9. LoRA Types

| LoRA type | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Personal LoRA | Single user |
| Domain LoRA | Workspace / project |
| Task LoRA | Narrow function (e.g. legal review) |
| Council-derived LoRA | Sanitized expert synthesis |

All LoRAs are versioned, immutable, and explicitly activated.

---

## 10. Router Inputs

The LoRA Router evaluates:
- Query intent
- Required domain expertise
- Base model confidence estimate
- Historical success rate of LoRAs
- Cost / latency budget

---

## 11. Routing Policy (Default)

### 11.1 Normal Path (approx 80-90%)

Base SLM + Personal LoRA (if exists) + Local GraphRAG

Used when:
- Confidence >= threshold
- Query within known domain
- No conflicting signals

### 11.2 Expert Path

Base SLM + Personal LoRA + Domain LoRA + Local GraphRAG

Triggered when:
- Domain match is strong
- Past evaluations show LoRA benefit
- Confidence borderline but acceptable

### 11.3 Escalation Path

Triggered when:
- Confidence < minimum threshold
- Conflicting reasoning detected
- High-risk decision context

Escalation order:
1. Global Knowledge Cache (if answer exists)
2. Council of LLMs (parallel inference)
3. Result distilled and cached

Escalated outputs may generate new LoRA candidates.

---

## 12. LoRA Evaluation & Promotion

### 12.1 Evaluation Dataset

Each LoRA maintains:
- Fixed test prompts
- Known failure cases
- Drift detection metrics

### 12.2 Promotion Rules

A LoRA may become default only if:
- Improves accuracy
- Does not increase hallucinations
- Reduces escalation frequency

Otherwise it remains optional or is deprecated.

---

## 13. Rollback Policy

Rollback is instantaneous:
- Disable LoRA
- Revert routing decision

Rollback does not affect DBB history and does not modify past decisions.

---

## 14. Key Design Principles

- Decisions > conversations
- Silence > interruption
- Personal calibration > global optimization
- Escalate only when needed
- Never hide uncertainty

---

## 15. Summary

DBB ensures that important moments are captured without user effort. LoRA routing ensures that expertise compounds without degrading trust. Together, they form the reasoning backbone of Membria CE.
