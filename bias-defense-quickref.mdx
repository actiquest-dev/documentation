# Bias Defense Quick Reference

## Detection → Intervention Map

**Overconfidence detected?**
*   → Trigger **Pre-Mortem**
*   → Require 3 distinct failure scenarios

**Hidden disagreement detected?**
*   → **Block** quick-approve buttons
*   → Require explicit signoff from silent parties (forcing signal explication)

**Anchoring detected?**
*   → Force **"Alternatives Considered"** field
*   → Show historical decisions that used different anchors

**Confirmation detected?**
*   → Inject **Devil's Advocate** prompt
*   → Surface best-match contradicting evidence from Graph

## Red Flags for Manual Review

> [!WARNING]
> If any of these flags are raised, the system acts as a "Brake" rather than an accelerator.

*   **LLM Signal Confidence < 0.7**: Too ambiguous for automation.
*   **VoI Estimate Variance > 50%**: Stakeholders fundamentally disagree on impact; averaging is dangerous.
*   **Resonance Score > 0.6**: User and AI are reinforcing each other's hallucinations.
*   **Cultural Context Mismatch**: Signal extraction model does not match team's communication style (e.g., Low Context model on High Context team).
*   **LoRA Confidence Adjustment > 30%**: The adapter is aggressively overriding the base model's uncertainty.
