# Membria CE Knowledge Base

This folder now hosts the **Membria CE knowledge base**—a single source of product positioning, playbooks, and signals compiled directly from `membria.md`.

## How it works
- `membria.md` is the research log. Add new insights at the bottom so that the polished pages can stay aligned with the latest thinking.
- MDX pages (index, quickstart, development, essentials, ai-tools, api-reference) keep the knowledge base visitor-friendly and are published publicly.
- Use `mint dev` to preview locally whenever you update a public page; the underlying tooling relies on the Mint CLI, but every page is about Membria CE.

## Contributing
1. Capture new strategy, architecture, or pricing ideas in `membria.md`.
2. When you want a broader audience to see the insight, translate it into the appropriate MDX page (landing, playbook, signal, API guide, etc.).
3. Preview with `mint dev` and review in the browser before committing.

If you need help triaging where something belongs, ask: does it belong in the research log or the knowledge base? Then proceed with edits and keep the tone consistent with the Membria CE voice.
