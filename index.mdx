## Membria Docs

**Membria is a persistent intelligence layer that preserves reasoning, decisions, and knowledge across AI tools and time.**
It runs as a personal system, a team SaaS, or an enterprise platform -- with the same core architecture.

Membria is not built to generate better answers.
It is built to make intelligence compound instead of resetting.

## Core concepts

All Membria products are built on the same core architecture:

- **Decision Surface** -- a live view of open, unresolved, drifting, or risky decisions.
- **Decision Black Box (DBB)** -- an agent that detects and records decisions as they happen.
- **Persistent Memory** -- a combination of long-context, GraphRAG, and decision records.
- **LoRA Expertise Routing** -- domain-specific skill amplification without global model drift.
- **Council Escalation** -- controlled use of stronger models when local intelligence is insufficient.

The difference between products is not *what* Membria does --
but *where it runs*, *who shares it*, and *how it is governed*.

## How to use this documentation

- Start with **Core Concepts** if you want to understand how Membria works.
- Jump directly to your product section if you already know what you are deploying.
- Enterprise readers should review governance and compliance sections early.

This documentation is designed for technical users and decision-makers.
If something feels underspecified, it probably is -- and should be made explicit.
