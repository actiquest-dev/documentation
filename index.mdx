## Introduction

Membria is a **Reasoning Graph for AI**.

It sits between people, teams, and AI models so that knowledge, reasoning, and decisions do not reset every time a conversation ends.

Most AI systems are stateless by design.
They respond, forget, and start over.

Membria adds the missing layer: **persistent intelligence**.

---

## What a Reasoning Graph is

A Reasoning Graph does not replace chat, documents, or AI models.

It focuses on one core function:

**preserving what matters over time for reasoning and decision-making.**

Membria's Reasoning Graph captures and structures:

- Decisions and their outcomes
- The reasoning behind those decisions
- Assumptions, constraints, and context
- Links between people, sources, and events

This information is stored in an explainable, queryable form that AI can reuse later instead of regenerating guesses.

---

## Why this layer is needed

Chats are noisy.
Documents are static.
Models are powerful but forgetful.

Without persistence:

- Teams repeat the same discussions
- Old decisions get reopened
- AI answers lack historical context
- Knowledge disappears when people leave

The Smart Persistence Layer ensures that intelligence **compounds instead of dissolving**.

## How Membria implements Reasoning Graph

Membria's Reasoning Graph is built through a set of coordinated systems:

- **Decision Black Box (DBB)**
  Automatically captures decisions from conversations, documents, and AI interactions.

- **Decision Surface (DS)**
  Makes decisions visible, trackable, and governable over time.

- **Decision Intelligence Engine (DI)**
  Optimizes human focus using Value of Information (VoI) and POMDP belief tracking.

- **Graph-based memory**
  Preserves causality, provenance, timelines, and ownership.

- **Local and shared knowledge caches**
  Reuses past reasoning instead of regenerating answers.

- **Controlled escalation**
  Consults stronger models only when confidence or risk requires it.

- **Decentralized knowledge backends**
  Enable persistence across environments without centralizing raw data.

Together, these components form a **persistent reasoning backbone**.

---

## One architecture, three products

All Membria products share the same Smart Persistence Layer, adapted to different trust boundaries and environments.

The difference is not what is remembered,
but **who owns it, how it is governed, and where it runs**.

## How to choose

- Choose **Membria CE** if you want a personal AI that remembers how *you* think.
- Choose **Membria for SMBs** if your team needs shared context without enterprise overhead.
- Choose **Membria EE** if you operate in regulated environments and require full control, auditability, and governance.

## The core idea

AI should not only answer questions.

It should remember **how and why decisions were made**.

Membria's Reasoning Graph makes that possible.
