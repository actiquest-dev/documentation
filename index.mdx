# Membria CE

Membria CE documents a two-layer system: **client-side decision capture** and **backend knowledge infrastructure**. Visit https://membria.xyz and follow @membria_ai on Twitter/X for updates.

## System layers

- **Client layer (Decision Surface + DBB):** captures decision moments, freezes reasoning before outcomes, and surfaces read-only signals.
- **Backend layer (KCG + DoD + Peaq + Arweave):** handles escalations, council reasoning, and immutable storage in the Knowledge Cache Graph.

## Design goals

- **Clarity over chat:** focus on decision pivots, not full conversation threads.
- **Immutable records:** decisions are signed; outcomes are appended, not rewritten.
- **Signal-first UI:** drift, consistency, and open loops are surfaced explicitly.
