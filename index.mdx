# Welcome to Membria

## Introduction

Membria is a **Smart Persistence Layer (SPL) for AI**.

It sits between people, teams, and AI models so that knowledge, reasoning, and decisions do not reset every time a conversation ends.

Most AI systems are stateless by design.
They respond, forget, and start over.

Membria adds the missing layer: **persistent intelligence**.

---

## What a Smart Persistence Layer is

A Smart Persistence Layer does not replace chat, documents, or AI models.

It does one thing deliberately and well:
it preserves what matters over time.

Membria's SPL captures:
- Decisions and their outcomes
- The reasoning behind those decisions
- Assumptions, constraints, and context
- Links between people, sources, and events

This information is stored in a structured, explainable form that AI can reuse later.

---

## Why this layer is needed

Chats are noisy.
Documents are static.
Models are powerful but forgetful.

Without persistence:
- Teams repeat the same discussions
- Old decisions get reopened
- AI answers lack context
- Knowledge disappears when people leave

The Smart Persistence Layer ensures that intelligence **compounds instead of dissolving**.

---

## How Membria implements SPL

Membria's SPL is built through a set of coordinated systems:

- **Decision Black Box (DBB)** -- automatically captures decisions from conversations and work
- **Decision Surface (DS)** -- makes decisions visible, trackable, and governable
- **Graph-based memory** -- preserves causality, provenance, and timelines
- **Local and shared knowledge caches** -- reuse past reasoning instead of re-generating it
- **Controlled escalation** -- consults stronger models only when necessary

Together, these systems form a persistent reasoning backbone.

---

## One architecture, three products

All Membria products share the same Smart Persistence Layer, adapted to different environments:

- **Membria CE (Personal)** -- SPL for individual power users
- **Membria for SMBs (SaaS)** -- SPL for teams and shared workspaces
- **Membria EE (Enterprise)** -- SPL for regulated, on-prem environments

The difference is not what is remembered, but **who owns it, how it is governed, and where it runs**.

---

## The core idea

AI should not only answer questions.

It should remember **how and why decisions were made**.

Membria's Smart Persistence Layer makes that possible.
