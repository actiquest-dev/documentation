## Membria Documentation

**Membria is a persistent intelligence layer that preserves reasoning, decisions, and knowledge across AI tools and time.**
It runs as a personal system, a team SaaS, or an enterprise platform -- with the same core architecture.

Membria is not built to generate better answers.
It is built to make intelligence compound instead of resetting.

  <Card title="Membria CE -- Personal (Community Edition)" icon="sparkles" href="/membria-ce/overview">
    Membria CE is designed for individual power users who work across many AI tools, chats, and contexts.
    It runs local-first, accumulates personal knowledge and reasoning, and extracts decisions automatically from everyday work.
    Cloud models are used only when needed, and results are cached to strengthen your local system over time.

    **Best for:** founders, engineers, researchers, independent creators.

  <Card title="Membria for SMBs -- Team SaaS" icon="building" href="/membria-smb/overview">
    Membria for SMBs is a managed SaaS for small teams that need shared reasoning, decision continuity, and organizational memory.
    It turns team discussions, chats, and documents into a living Decision Surface that shows what is open, unresolved, drifting, or risky.
    The system is shared, but reasoning remains explainable and auditable.

    **Best for:** startups, product teams, research groups.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Membria EE -- Enterprise Edition" icon="shield" href="/membria-ee/overview">
    Membria EE is an enterprise-grade deployment for organizations that require governance, compliance, and long-term institutional memory.
    It supports on-prem and hybrid deployments, strict access control, audit trails, and policy enforcement -- without sacrificing explainability.
    Decisions remain traceable even when people, tools, or models change.

    **Best for:** regulated enterprises, financial institutions, large organizations.

## Core concepts (shared across all products)

All Membria products are built on the same core architecture:

- **Decision Surface** -- a live view of open, unresolved, drifting, or risky decisions.
- **Decision Black Box (DBB)** -- an agent that detects and records decisions as they happen.
- **Persistent Memory** -- a combination of long-context, GraphRAG, and decision records.
- **LoRA Expertise Routing** -- domain-specific skill amplification without global model drift.
- **Council Escalation** -- controlled use of stronger models when local intelligence is insufficient.

The difference between products is not *what* Membria does --
but *where it runs*, *who shares it*, and *how it is governed*.

## How to use this documentation

- Start with **Core Concepts** if you want to understand how Membria works.
- Jump directly to your product section if you already know what you are deploying.
- Enterprise readers should review governance and compliance sections early.

This documentation is designed for technical users and decision-makers.
If something feels underspecified, it probably is -- and should be made explicit.
