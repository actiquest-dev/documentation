## Pattern detection

The system analyzes decision history for:

- **Cognitive biases** (optimism bias, recency bias, underweighting health consequences).
- **Behavioral patterns** (decisions after 8 PM, under deadline pressure, impulsive purchases).
- **Blind spots** (topics consistently missing from decision criteria).

Signals combine frequency, confidence, and outcome data so you can compare predicted confidence with actual results.

## Principles tracker

Set personal rules ("never work for free", "sleep on $1000+ decisions") and receive alerts when a decision candidate violates them. Each violation is logged so trends are visible over time.

## Calibration training

- Daily micro-predictions keep calibration active.
- Outcome reviews compare confidence vs. actual results and highlight persistent overconfidence or underconfidence.
