## Decision Surface anatomy

Decision Surface translates DBB records into signal cards. Each card answers one question:

- **Open loops:** captured decisions that remain unresolved.
- **Drift:** assumptions that changed after the decision was captured.
- **Pending outcomes:** decisions that require an outcome entry.
- **Track record:** aggregated accuracy by domain (career, finance, health).

Use the inline reasoning panel to review evidence, update context, or confirm the decision. The original record remains immutable; updates are added as new notes.

## Acting on signals

1. **Prioritize:** a drift + pending outcome card indicates a shifting assumption and a missing review.
2. **Calibrate:** compare confidence vs. reality and note the gap.
3. **Close or defer:** confirm the decision when evidence is sufficient, or leave it open until more data is available.
