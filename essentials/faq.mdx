## What is Membria Community Edition?

Membria CE is a local-first AI system with a client layer (Decision Surface + Decision Black Box) and a backend knowledge layer (KCG + DoD + Peaq + Arweave). It is designed for decision capture, long-term reasoning, and reusable knowledge—not just chat.

## Is Membria just another AI assistant?

No. Chat is only one interface. Membria extracts decisions, reasoning, and knowledge from conversations and stores them as structured records so they can be reused over time.

## What makes Membria useful for power users?

Membria is built for people who work across many tools, models, and chats. It captures decisions and reasoning as structured memory and keeps the original context intact so intelligence accumulates across sessions.

## What should I expect from chat mode in Membria?

Chat feels familiar, but the output is captured as decisions, knowledge, and outcomes. The system treats chat as input, not the source of truth.

## What problem does Membria solve?

Reasoning happens across many systems, but it rarely accumulates. Membria captures the reasoning and decisions behind work so patterns, drift, and outcomes can be reviewed later.

## Who is Membria for?

Power users: founders, researchers, PMs, engineers, and developers who make frequent decisions and need long-term context.

## How is Membria different from ChatGPT?

ChatGPT optimizes for the current session. Membria preserves decision reasoning, assumptions, and outcomes across sessions, tools, and models.

## How is Membria different from Notion AI?

Notion AI summarizes and searches documents. Membria indexes decisions and causal links across time, with explicit provenance and reasoning chains.

## Does Membria run locally or in the cloud?

Membria CE supports both. The client layer runs locally; the backend knowledge layer is decentralized. A managed cloud path is available for faster onboarding.

## What happens when local AI is not enough?

The client escalates a request to the backend via DoD. A council of models validates the response, stores it in the KCG, and returns a verified result that the client can reuse.

## What are LoRA patches in Membria?

LoRA patches are local adapters that encode expertise learned from escalations, decisions, and verified answers. They reduce repeated mistakes and improve specialization over time.

## How does memory work in Membria?

Membria does not store raw chat history. It stores decision records, knowledge artifacts, and outcomes. Only stable, reusable information is retained.

## What is the Decision Surface?

The Decision Surface is the client dashboard showing open loops, drift, and pending outcomes derived from decision records.

## What is the Decision Black Box (DBB)?

DBB is a client-side agent that detects decisions, captures reasoning, and writes immutable decision records at the moment they occur.

## What insights does Membria provide over time?

It surfaces repeated assumptions, blind spots, and calibration gaps by comparing predictions to outcomes.

## Why use Membria instead of just thinking things through?

Because reasoning without durable capture does not accumulate. Membria turns decisions into a compounding record that can be reviewed and improved.

## How does Membria help developers using Claude Code or Codex?

Membria captures trade-offs, constraints, and architectural decisions across code discussions so teams can review why choices were made.

## How does Membria help consultants or strategists?

It records the assumptions and context behind recommendations and later compares them to outcomes, reducing repeated mistakes across clients.

## How does Membria help researchers?

It records hypotheses, abandoned paths, and the reasons they were dropped, preventing repeated dead ends.

## Why is this useful for AI power users?

Power users make frequent decisions across many contexts. Membria preserves the original reasoning so learning compounds instead of resetting.
