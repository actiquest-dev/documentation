## Target users

| Tier | Archetype | Pain point | Value proposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Investors & traders | Emotion-driven bets, limited reasoning record | Immutable decision capture for trading choices |
| Tier 2 | Rationalists & self-optimizers | Need calibration and data | Calibration metrics from real decisions |
| Tier 3 | Life transition people | High-stakes choices, coaching is expensive | Structured decision capture without coaching costs |
| Tier 4 | Anxious decision-makers | Rumination, decision paralysis | Reduced replay via explicit decision records |

## Go-to-market roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Niche launch (investors).** Clear ROI and measurable outcomes.
2. **Phase 2: Rationalists.** Community-driven adoption once calibration signals are visible.
3. **Phase 3: Mainstream self-improvement.** Simplified UX and broader wellness positioning.

## Key risks & mitigations

- **Users quit after two weeks** → AI lowers friction, quick wins, streak nudges.
- **ChatGPT adds memory** → Focus on decision-specific immutability and signal stack.
- **Psychological resistance** → Frame as scientific self-discovery, not an error log.
- **Long feedback loops** → Micro-decisions and outcome reminders maintain engagement.
