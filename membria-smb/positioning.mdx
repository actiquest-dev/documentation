## Product definition

Membria SaaS is an institutional decision memory platform for professional services firms (audit, legal, consulting). It captures, stores, and makes reusable the collective decision experience of an organization.

## Tagline

**"AI that remembers WHY"**

Alternatives:
- "Decisions with memory"
- "Your firm's reasoning, preserved"
- "Institutional memory that compounds"

---

## The problem

Professional services firms are losing their primary advantage: accumulated decision experience.

**Symptoms:**

| Problem | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| A partner leaves and takes 20 years of context | Client loss, repeated mistakes |
| "We already solved this" but no one remembers how | About 30 percent of expert time spent re-analyzing |
| Different partners decide the same cases differently | Reputational risk, inconsistency |
| Juniors do not know precedents | Slow onboarding, lower quality |
| Knowledge trapped in heads, email, scattered docs | Impossible to find when needed |

**Root cause:**

Firms store **documents**, not **decisions**.

- Document = what was done.
- Decision = why it was done, plus context, alternatives, and outcome.

---

## The solution

Membria is the decision memory layer for an organization.

- Captures decisions from real workstreams
- Preserves reasoning with evidence and outcomes
- Enables reuse of precedents
- Detects drift from firm standards
- Prevents loss of knowledge when people leave

## Category: Institutional decision memory

Membria is not:
- Knowledge management (stores documents)
- AI search (finds information)
- Decision automation (AI decides for you)

Membria is **decision memory**:
- Captures decisions, not just documents
- Preserves reasoning, not just outcomes
- Enables reuse, not just retrieval
- Detects drift, not just search

---

## One-line differentiator

**"Others store documents. Membria governs decisions."**
