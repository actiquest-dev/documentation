# From Chat to Institutional Memory

## The problem

Teams talk constantly.

Decisions happen in:
- Chats
- Comments
- Documents
- AI conversations

But once the conversation ends, the reasoning disappears.

New team members ask the same questions.
Old decisions get reopened.
Context is lost.

---

## What Membria changes

Membria does not try to replace chat.

Instead, it treats chat as **raw material**.

Chats are inputs.
Decisions are the output.

---

## Step 1: Work normally

Teams continue to:
- Chat
- Review documents
- Use AI
- Make decisions informally

Nothing new to learn.
Nothing new to maintain.

---

## Step 2: DBB captures what matters

In the background, DBB:
- Observes discussions
- Detects decision moments
- Extracts outcomes and assumptions

This happens automatically.

---

## Step 3: Decisions become memory

Captured decisions are:
- Stored in the workspace knowledge graph
- Linked to context and sources
- Available to the entire team

They persist even when people leave.

---

## Step 4: Decision Surface makes it visible

The Decision Surface shows:
- What is still open
- What changed
- What repeats
- What never resolved

Teams see their thinking, not their chat history.

---

## Step 5: AI gets smarter over time

When you ask questions later:
- AI answers using real team decisions
- Not generic patterns
- Not hallucinated summaries

Each decision improves the next answer.

---

## The result

Membria turns:
- Conversations -> decisions
- Decisions -> memory
- Memory -> better future decisions

Without extra work.

---

## Why this matters

Most tools forget.
Membria compounds.

That is the difference between productivity and institutional intelligence.
