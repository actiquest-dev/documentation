# Getting started

This guide walks you through the first steps of setting up Membria for SMBs.
The goal is simple: get shared context working fast, without configuration overhead.

Membria is designed so that you can see value before you finish full ingestion.

---

## Step 1: Create a workspace

A workspace represents one team or organization.

When you create a workspace:
- You define the shared context boundary
- You establish ownership and admin rights
- You isolate data, LoRA scopes, and audit logs

Best practice:
- One workspace per company or independent team
- Avoid mixing unrelated teams in the same workspace

---

## Step 2: Invite team members

Invite colleagues who participate in decisions or consume shared knowledge.

Roles are lightweight by default:
- **Admin**: manages sources, access, and settings
- **Member**: queries, contributes, and reviews knowledge

You can adjust permissions later. Early onboarding works best when at least 3-5 people join, so Membria can capture real decision flow.

---

## Step 3: Connect shared sources

Connect the systems where your team already works.

Typical sources include:
- Document storage (Drive, SharePoint, folders)
- Knowledge bases and wikis
- Internal notes and project documentation

For each source, define:
- Who can access it
- Whether it is read-only or update-aware
- Whether it contributes to shared reasoning

Membria respects existing access boundaries. It does not bypass permissions.

---

## Step 4: Run initial ingestion

Start ingestion to build the first shared knowledge graph.

During this phase:
- Documents are indexed
- Key entities and events are extracted
- Initial decision signals are detected

You do not need perfect coverage at this stage.
Partial ingestion is enough to begin querying and exploring.

---

## Step 5: Review the Decision Surface

After ingestion, open the Decision Surface.

This is where Membria differs from standard search:
- You see what the team already knows
- You see gaps and repeated questions
- You can explore decisions, not just documents

Use this step to validate that:
- Sources are connected correctly
- Access scopes behave as expected
- Early signals match real team context

---

## Step 6: Start using Membria in daily work

From here, treat Membria as part of normal work:
- Ask questions
- Revisit past decisions
- Share findings with teammates

Membria improves as it observes real usage.
You do not need to train it manually.

---

## What to do next

After basic onboarding, most teams proceed to:
- Refining access scopes
- Adding domain-specific LoRA patches
- Enabling alerts and governance features

These steps are optional and can be done gradually.

---

## Notes on expectations

Membria is not a one-time setup tool.
It compounds value as your team works.

The first week focuses on visibility.
The following weeks focus on reuse and decision continuity.
