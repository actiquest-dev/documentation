# Decision Black Box Heuristics (SMB Edition)

## Purpose

DBB heuristics determine **when something is a decision worth recording**.

For SMBs, heuristics are intentionally:
- Conservative
- Explainable
- Low-noise

The goal is trust, not completeness.

---

## Confidence-based capture model

Every potential decision signal receives a confidence score.

Only signals above the persistence threshold are recorded.

Confidence is derived from multiple lightweight features.

---

## Core heuristic signals

### 1. Explicit resolution language

Phrases indicating closure or commitment:
- "We will..."
- "Let's proceed with..."
- "Approved"
- "Final decision"

Strong positive signal.

---

### 2. Convergence after discussion

Signals increase when:
- Multiple viewpoints collapse into one
- Alternatives stop appearing
- Follow-up actions align

Medium to strong signal depending on clarity.

---

### 3. Approval or status change

Examples:
- Document approval
- Merge or publish action
- Formal sign-off

High-confidence signal.

---

### 4. Rejection of alternatives

Explicitly rejected options strengthen confidence:
- "We won't do X"
- "Option A is not viable"

Adds context, not a standalone decision.

---

### 5. Temporal persistence

If a topic:
- Reappears across days or weeks
- Retains similar framing

Confidence increases that a real decision context exists.

---

## Negative signals (noise reduction)

DBB suppresses capture when:
- Discussions are exploratory
- Language remains hypothetical
- No convergence is detected
- The same topic oscillates without closure

Long discussions without resolution are flagged but not recorded.

---

## False positives handling

When a captured decision is marked incorrect:
- DBB records the correction as an event
- Original capture is preserved
- Confidence weighting is adjusted

No history is erased.

---

## SMB-specific constraints

Compared to Enterprise:
- Fewer policy layers
- No manual approval workflows
- Faster decay of low-confidence signals
- Smaller evaluation windows

This keeps DBB lightweight and unobtrusive.

---

## Summary

DBB heuristics for SMBs prioritize:
- Precision over recall
- Trust over automation
- Persistence over activity tracking

Only decisions that matter survive.
