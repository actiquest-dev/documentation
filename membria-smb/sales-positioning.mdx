description: "Pitch, key messages, and objection handling for Membria SaaS."
---

> Professional services firms lose their most valuable asset every time a senior person leaves, not their clients but their judgment. 
> Membria captures the reasoning behind every important decision so your firm's collective wisdom compounds instead of walking out the door. > We are the institutional memory layer that sits on top of your existing tools.

## Key messages

**For managing partners:**
"Stop losing 20 years of expertise when partners retire. Membria preserves the reasoning, not just the documents."

**For risk and compliance:**
"When regulators ask why you decided this, you will have the answer. Every decision is documented with full context."

**For practice leaders:**
"New associates find the right precedent in seconds instead of hours. Decisions stay consistent across the practice."

## Objection handling

| Objection | Response |
| --- | --- |
| We have SharePoint or Confluence | Those store documents. Membria captures decisions and the reasoning behind them. |
| Our partners will not use another system | Decision Surface is 5 minutes per day. Butler works inside Teams or Outlook. |
| We tried knowledge management and it failed | KM fails because it requires manual tagging. Membria extracts decisions automatically. |
| What about data security | On-prem option, SOC 2 architecture, data never leaves your control. |
| How is this different from Copilot | Copilot searches documents. Membria understands decisions and drift. |
