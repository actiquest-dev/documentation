## Core: FalkorDB GraphRAG

Membria uses a hybrid GraphRAG approach where graph and vector retrieval are executed in a single system. Embeddings live inside graph nodes to avoid sync issues between separate stores.

## Event schema (Wikontic-inspired)

Every decision is stored as a structured event:

```
DECISION EVENT:
- WHO: Partner | Associate | Committee
- WHAT: Decision | Precedent | Matter | Document
- WHEN: Timestamp (immutable)
- WHY: Reasoning text (embedded as vector)
- CONTEXT: Client, matter, practice area
- RELATIONS:
  - approved_by -> Person
  - references -> Precedent
  - deviates_from -> Standard
  - resulted_in -> Outcome
  - linked_to -> Document
- QUALIFIERS: confidence, status, review_required
```

## Integration architecture

Membria connects to the systems you already use:

- Document watcher (extracts decisions from docs)
- Email analyzer (detects decision discussions)
- Meeting summarizer (captures verbal decisions)

These connectors feed the Membria core (GraphRAG, Decision Surface, DBB).

## Deployment options

| Option | Description | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud SaaS | Multi-tenant, Membria-hosted | SMB, quick start |
| Private cloud | Single-tenant, customer cloud | Mid-market, compliance |
| On-premise | Customer infrastructure | Enterprise, banks |
