## Primary: SMB professional services (50 to 500 employees)

| Segment | Why Membria | Key pain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit firms | High-stakes decisions, regulatory scrutiny | Consistency across engagements |
| Law firms | Precedent-driven work, partner knowledge critical | Knowledge walks out the door |
| Management consulting | Methodology reuse, client patterns | Reinventing frameworks |
| Tax advisory | Complex rulings, interpretation consistency | Different answers to the same question |
| Compliance and risk | Audit trail required, reasoning documentation | "Why did we approve this?" |

## Why SMB, not enterprise

| Factor | Enterprise | SMB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sales cycle | 12 to 18 months | 2 to 4 months |
| Decision maker | Committee | Managing partner |
| Implementation | Complex IT integration | Works on top of existing tools |
| Price sensitivity | Lower | Higher, needs clear ROI |
| Competition | Microsoft, Glean, etc. | Underserved |
