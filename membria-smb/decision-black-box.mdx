## Overview

Decision Black Box (DBB) is a background reasoning agent in Membria for SMBs that **automatically captures team decisions as they happen**.

DBB does not replace chat, workflows, or tools.
It observes them and extracts **decision signals** from everyday work -- conversations, documents, reviews, and approvals -- turning ephemeral activity into **institutional memory**.

For SMB teams, DBB solves a core problem:
> important decisions happen constantly, but are rarely documented, tracked, or revisited.

---

## What DBB is (and is not)

### DBB is:
- A **non-intrusive background agent**
- Focused on **decision capture**, not summarization
- Designed to work across **multiple tools and sources**
- Always on, but **rarely visible**

### DBB is not:
- A chat interface
- A task manager
- A monitoring or surveillance tool
- A judgment or scoring system

DBB records *what was decided*, not *who said what*.

---

## How DBB works in a team environment

### 1. Observation layer

DBB continuously observes team activity across connected sources:
- Team chat (Slack, Teams, internal chat)
- Documents and comments
- Reviews, approvals, and status changes
- AI-assisted outputs generated in Membria

At this stage, **no reasoning or conclusions are produced**.

---

### 2. Decision signal detection

DBB looks for **decision patterns**, such as:
- Explicit resolutions ("We'll proceed with option B")
- Repeated convergence after discussion
- Approval events
- Rejected alternatives
- Commitments tied to actions or owners

Signals are detected probabilistically, with confidence scores.

---

### 3. Decision extraction

When confidence crosses a threshold, DBB extracts:
- The decision itself
- The context in which it was made
- Key assumptions
- Considered alternatives (if present)
- Responsible parties (if identifiable)
- Timestamp and source references

This extraction is **structural**, not interpretive.

---

### 4. Persistence into the workspace Reasoning Graph

Captured decisions are written into the workspace's **Smart Persistence Layer**:
- Linked to relevant documents and discussions
- Connected to prior related decisions
- Available to the Decision Surface and search

Once stored, decisions become part of the **shared reasoning fabric** of the team.

---

## Visibility and user experience

### Default behavior

DBB operates silently.
Most of the time, teams do not interact with DBB directly.

Its output surfaces indirectly through:
- Decision Surface signals
- Search results with provenance
- Historical context in AI responses

---

### Optional review and correction

When needed, teams can:
- Review captured decisions
- Add clarifications or annotations
- Mark decisions as outdated or superseded

Corrections do not erase history.
DBB preserves the original capture and records updates as new events.

---

## False positives and confidence handling

DBB uses conservative heuristics to minimize noise:
- Low-confidence signals are not persisted
- Ambiguous discussions remain uncaptured
- Long discussions without closure are flagged, not recorded

If a false positive occurs:
- Teams can mark it as "not a decision"
- DBB learns from the correction
- Future confidence thresholds are adjusted

---

## Team governance and scope

### Workspace-level control

In Membria for SMBs:
- DBB operates at the **workspace level**
- All captured decisions belong to the team, not individuals
- Access follows workspace permissions

---

### Escalation awareness

DBB is escalation-aware:
- It records when AI escalation influenced a decision
- It links decisions to escalated knowledge when applicable
- It helps teams understand *why* certain answers were trusted

---

## Why DBB matters for SMB teams

Without DBB:
- Decisions live in chats, emails, and meetings
- Context is lost when people leave
- Teams repeat mistakes or re-litigate old choices

With DBB:
- Decisions persist beyond tools and people
- New team members ramp up faster
- AI responses improve using real team history
- Institutional memory compounds naturally

DBB turns **daily collaboration into durable knowledge** -- without adding process overhead.

---

## Relationship to Decision Surface

DBB feeds the Decision Surface.
The Decision Surface shows:
- Open decisions
- Unresolved assumptions
- Drift and contradictions
- Historical outcomes

DBB captures.
Decision Surface reveals.

Together, they form the reasoning layer of Membria for SMBs.

---

## Summary

Decision Black Box enables SMB teams to:
- Preserve decisions without manual effort
- Maintain continuity across tools and time
- Build shared reasoning capital
- Reduce repeated discussions and hidden risk

DBB works quietly in the background, ensuring that **what matters is never lost**.
