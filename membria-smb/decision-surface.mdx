# Decision Surface

## Overview

The Decision Surface is the primary interface in Membria. It is not a dashboard of charts. It is a working surface for governance and decision continuity.

It shows:
- open decisions
- alignment drift
- precedent reuse
- blind spots
- action items that require review

## Signal cards (system health)

Signal cards monitor system state and do not require action.

| Card | What it shows | States |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decisions | Pipeline: completed to in review to pending | Stable, Activity, Attention |
| Alignment | Drift from firm standards by practice area | Stable, Drifting, Critical |
| Precedents | Which precedents are used, by whom, how often | Improving, Stable, Concern |
| Blind spots | Areas with no precedents or expertise | Clear, Spreading, Critical |

**Card states:**

| State | Visual | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | Gray border | No action needed |
| Activity | Blue dot | Recent changes, FYI |
| Attention | Orange left border | Needs review |
| Critical | Full orange border | Urgent action required |

## Action items (agent signals)

These cards require action and are generated by agents.

| Agent | What it detects | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reuse | Over-reliance on a single precedent | "79 percent reuse based on one precedent" |
| Deviation | Drift from established patterns | "Custom revenue terms deviated in similar contexts" |
| Risk | Governance blind spots | "Teams under Automated Reporting lack peer review" |
| Pending | Decisions awaiting approval | "3 decisions await your sign-off" |
| Custom | User-defined rules | "Fee variance exceeds 15 percent on 2 matters" |

## Chat panel

Three modes of communication:

| Tab | Participants | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team | All team and Butler | Discussion tied to a signal or card |
| Direct | You and a colleague (Butler optional) | Private one-to-one discussion |
| Butler | You and Butler only | Personal assistant for search and questions |

**Butler** is an AI assistant that:
- participates in team discussions
- responds to explicit mentions
- surfaces precedents and explains decisions
- can be added to direct chats

## Key takeaway

The Decision Surface is a governance layer that turns signals into action and keeps decision continuity visible over time.
