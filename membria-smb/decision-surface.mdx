# Decision Surface for SMBs

## Overview

The Decision Surface is the primary workspace view in Membria for SMBs.
It turns captured decisions into a **living map of what matters right now** for the team.

Unlike dashboards or task boards, the Decision Surface does not track activity.
It tracks **decision state over time**.

Its purpose is simple:
help teams see what is unresolved, drifting, risky, or repeating -- without reading chats or documents.

---

## What the Decision Surface shows

The Decision Surface is built entirely on top of the Decision Black Box (DBB).

It aggregates and visualizes:

- Active decisions
- Unresolved assumptions
- Repeated or contradictory reasoning
- Decisions without outcomes
- Areas where escalation or rework is happening

Nothing appears on the Decision Surface unless DBB has captured a decision signal.

---

## Core sections

### Active decisions

Decisions that:
- Have been made
- Are still relevant
- Have not yet produced a clear outcome

These typically represent:
- Ongoing projects
- Strategic choices
- Operational commitments

---

### Unresolved or drifting decisions

Decisions are flagged as drifting when:
- The same topic reappears across time
- Assumptions change without a new explicit decision
- Different team members act on different interpretations

This helps teams catch misalignment early.

---

### Decisions without outcome

DBB tracks whether a decision ever produced a measurable result.

If a decision:
- Was made
- But never validated, reversed, or closed

It remains visible as an open loop.

---

### Repeated decisions

If similar decisions are made multiple times across the workspace,
the Decision Surface highlights them as patterns.

This often reveals:
- Missing standards
- Knowledge gaps
- Opportunities to create playbooks or templates

---

## How DS uses DBB data

The Decision Surface does not infer or guess.

It uses DBB outputs directly:
- Decision objects
- Confidence scores
- Temporal links
- Provenance (where the decision came from)

Each card on the Decision Surface is traceable back to:
- The original context
- Supporting documents
- Related discussions

---

## Interaction model

The Decision Surface is not a command center.
It is a **review and orientation layer**.

Users can:
- Click into a decision for context
- Add clarifications or outcomes
- Mark decisions as superseded
- Link decisions to new work

Users do not need to manage or maintain it.

---

## Why this matters for SMB teams

In SMBs:
- Decisions are fast
- Context is fragmented
- Documentation is inconsistent

The Decision Surface gives teams:
- Shared awareness
- Continuity across time
- Reduced rework
- Faster onboarding for new members

It makes decision state visible -- without adding meetings or process.

---

## Summary

DBB captures decisions.
Decision Surface makes them visible.

Together, they form the core reasoning interface of Membria for SMBs.
